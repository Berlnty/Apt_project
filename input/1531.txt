Constraints on Definitions of Art</a></h2><p>Any definition of art has to square with the following uncontroversialfacts: (i) entities (artifacts or performances) intentionally endowedby their makers with a significant degree of aesthetic interest, oftensurpassing that of most everyday objects, exist in virtually everyknown human culture; (ii) such entities, and traditions devoted tothem, might be produced by non-human species, and might exist in otherpossible worlds; (iii) such entities sometimes have non-aesthetic&mdash;ceremonial or religious or propagandistic&mdash;functions,and sometimes do not; (iv) traditionally, artworks are intentionallyendowed by their makers with properties, usually perceptual, having asignificant degree of aesthetic interest, often surpassing that ofmost everyday objects; (v) art, so understood, has a complicatedhistory: new genres and art-forms develop, standards of taste evolve,understandings of aesthetic properties and aesthetic experiencechange; (vi) there are institutions in some but not all cultures whichinvolve a focus on artifacts and performances having a high degree ofaesthetic interest and lacking any practical, ceremonial, or religioususe; (vii) such institutions sometimes classify entities apparentlylacking aesthetic interest with entities having a high degree ofaesthetic interest; (viii) many things other than artworks&mdash;forexample, natural entities (sunsets, landscapes, flowers, shadows),human beings, and abstract entities (theories, proofs) are routinelydescribed as having aesthetic properties. </p><p>Of these facts, those having to do with art&rsquo;s cultural and historicalfeatures are emphasized by some definitions of art. Other definitionsof art give priority to explaining those facts that reflect art&rsquo;suniversality and continuity with other aesthetic phenomena. </p><p>There are also two more general constraints on definitions of art.First, given that accepting that something is inexplicable isgenerally a philosophical last resort, and granting the importance ofextensional adequacy, list-like or enumerative definitions are ifpossible to be avoided. Enumerative definitions, lacking principlesthat explain why what is on the list is on the list, don&rsquo;t,notoriously, apply to <em>definienda</em> that evolve, and provide noclue to the next or general case (Tarski&rsquo;s definition of truth, forexample, is standardly criticized as unenlightening because it restson a list-like definition of primitive denotation; see Devitt 2001;Davidson 2005). Second, given that most classes outside ofmathematics are vague, and that the existence of borderline cases ischaracteristic of vague classes, definitions that take the class ofartworks to have borderline cases are preferable to definitions thatdon&rsquo;t (Davies 1991 and 2006; Stecker 2005).</p><p>Whether any definition of art does account for these facts andsatisfy these constraints, or <em>could</em> account for these factsand satisfy these constraints, are key questions for the philosophy ofart.</p><h2><a name="TraDef">2. Traditional Definitions</a></h2><p>Traditional definitions, at least as commonly portrayed incontemporary discussions of the definition of art, take artworks to becharacterized by a single type of property. The standard candidates arerepresentational properties, expressive properties, and formalproperties. So there are representational or mimetic definitions,expressive definitions, and formalist definitions, which hold thatartworks are characterized by their possession of, respectively,representational, expressive, and formal properties. It is notdifficult to find fault with these simple definitions. For example,possessing representational, expressive, and formal properties cannotbe sufficient conditions, since, obviously, instructional manuals arerepresentations, but not typically artworks, human faces and gestureshave expressive properties without being works of art, and both naturalobjects and artifacts produced for the homeliest utilitarian purposeshave formal properties but are not artworks.</p><p>But the ease of these dismissals serves as a reminder of the factthat traditional definitions of art are not self-contained. Eachtraditional definition stands in (different) close and complicatedrelationships to its system&rsquo;s other complexly interwoven parts&mdash;epistemology, ontology, value theory, philosophy of mind, etc.For this reason, it is both difficult and somewhat misleading toextract them and consider them in isolation. Two examples ofhistorically influential definitions of art offered by greatphilosophers will suffice to illustrate. First, Plato holds in the<em>Republic</em> and elsewhere that the arts are representational, or<em>mimetic</em> (sometimes translated &ldquo;imitative&rdquo;).Artworks are ontologically dependent on, and inferior to,ordinary physical objects, which in turn are ontologically dependenton, and inferior to, what is most real, the non-physical Forms. Graspedperceptually, artworks present only an appearance of an appearance ofwhat is really real. Consequently, artistic experience cannot yieldknowledge. Nor do the makers of artworks work from knowledge. Becauseartworks engage an unstable, lower part of the soul, art should besubservient to moral realities, which, along with truth, are moremetaphysically fundamental and hence more humanly important thanbeauty. Beauty is not, for Plato, the distinctive province of the arts,and in fact his conception of beauty is extremely wide andmetaphysical: there is a Form of Beauty, of which we can havenon-perceptual knowledge, but it is more closely related to the eroticthan to the arts. (See Janaway 1998, and the entry on <a href="../plato-rhetoric/">Plato on Rhetoric and Poetry</a>.)Second, although Kant has adefinition of art, he is for systematic reasons far less concerned withit than with aesthetic judgment. Kant defines art as &ldquo;a kind ofrepresentation that is purposive in itself and, though without an end,nevertheless promotes the cultivation of the mental powers for sociablecommunication&rdquo; (Kant, <em>Critique of Judgment</em>, Guyertranslation, section 44).) The definition, when fully unpacked,has representational, formalist and expressivist elements. Locatedconceptually in a much broader discussion of aesthetic judgment andteleology, the definition is one relatively small piece of a hugelyambitious philosophical structure that attempts, famously, to accountfor, and work out the relationships between, scientific knowledge,morality, and religious faith. (See the entry on  <a href="../kant-aesthetics/">Kant&rsquo;s Aesthetics and Teleology</a>.)For treatments of influential definitionsof art, inseparable from the complex philosophical systems in whichthey occur, see, for example, the entries on <a href="../aesthetics-18th-german/">18th Century German Aesthetics</a>, <a href="../schopenhauer/">Arthur Schopenhauer</a>, <a href="../nietzsche/">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, and <a href="../dewey-aesthetics/">Dewey&rsquo;s Aesthetics</a>.</p><h2><a name="SkeAboDef">3. Skepticism about Definitions</a></h2><p>Skepticism about the possibility and value of a definition of art hasbeen an important part of the discussion in aesthetics since the 1950son, and though its influence has subsided, uneasiness about thedefinitional project persists. (See section 4, below, and also Kivy1997, and Walton 2007).</p><p>A common family of arguments, inspired by Wittgenstein&rsquo;sfamous remarks about games (Wittgenstein 1953), has it that thephenomena of art are, by their nature, too diverse to admit of theunification that a satisfactory definition strives for, or that adefinition of art, were there to be such a thing, would exert astifling influence on artistic creativity. One expression of thisimpulse is Weitz&rsquo;s Open Concept Argument: any concept isopen if a case can be imagined which would call for some sort ofdecision on our part to extend the use of the concept to cover it, orto close the concept and invent a new one to deal with the new case;all open concepts are indefinable; and there are cases calling for adecision about whether to extend or close the concept of art. Hence artis indefinable (Weitz 1956). Against this it is claimed thatchange does not, in general, rule out the preservation of identity overtime, that decisions about concept-expansion may be principled ratherthan capricious, and that nothing bars a definition of art fromincorporating a novelty requirement.</p><p>A second sort of argument, less common today than in theheyday of a certain form of extreme Wittgensteinianism, urges that theconcepts that make up the stuff of most definitions of art(expressiveness, form) are embedded in general philosophical theorieswhich incorporate traditional metaphysics and epistemology. But sincetraditional metaphysics and epistemology are prime instances oflanguage gone on conceptually confused holiday, definitions of artshare in the conceptual confusions of traditionalphilosophy (Tilghman 1984).</p><p>A third sort of argument, more historically inflected than the first,takes off from an influential study by the historian of philosophyPaul Kristeller, in which he argued that the modern system of the fivemajor arts [painting, sculpture, architecture, poetry, and music]which underlies all modern aesthetics &hellip; is of comparativelyrecent origin and did not assume definite shape before the eighteenthcentury, although it had many ingredients which go back to classical,mediaeval, and Renaissance thought.  Since that list of five arts issomewhat arbitrary, and since even those five do not share a singlecommon nature, but rather are united, at best, only by severaloverlapping features, and since the number of art forms has increasedsince the eighteenth century, Kristeller&rsquo;s work may be taken tosuggest that our concept of art differs from that of the eighteenthcentury. As a matter of historical fact, there simply is no stable<em>definiendum</em> for a definition of art to capture.</p><p>A fourth sort of argument suggests that a definition of art statingindividually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for a thing tobe an artwork, is likely to be discoverable only if cognitive sciencemakes it plausible to think that humans categorize things in terms ofnecessary and sufficient conditions. But, the argument continues,cognitive science actually supports the view that the structure ofconcepts mirrors the way humans categorize things&mdash;which is withrespect to their similarity to prototypes (or exemplars), and not interms of necessary and sufficient conditions. So the quest for adefinition of art that states individually necessary and jointlysufficient conditions is misguided and not likely to succeed (Dean2003). Against this it has been urged that psychological theoriesof concepts like the prototype theory and its relatives can provide atbest an account of how people <em>in fact</em> classify things, but notan account of <em>correct</em> classifications of extra-psychologicalphenomena, and that, even if relevant, prototype theory and otherpsychological theories of concepts are at present too controversial todraw substantive philosophical morals from (Rey 1983; Adajian 2005).</p><p>A fifth sort of argument concludes that defining art isphilosophically <em>unnecessary</em>, on the grounds that the problemof defining art reduces to a pair of easier sorts of problems: theproblem of giving an account of each individual artform, and theproblem of defining what it is to be an artform. That is, givendefinitions of the individual artforms, and a definition of what it isto be an artform, and given, crucially, that every artwork belongs tosome artform, a definition of art falls out: <em>x</em> is a <em>workof art</em> if and only if <em>x</em> is a work inactivity <em>P</em>, and <em>P</em> is one of the artforms (Lopes2008). Every artwork belongs to an artform, on this view, becauseevery artwork either belongs to an existing artwork or else pioneers anew artform.  The key claim that every work of art belonging to noextant artform pioneers a new one may be defended on the grounds thatany reason to say that a work belonging to no extant artform is anartwork is a reason to say that it pioneers a new artform.  Inresponse, it is noted that an activity might be ruled out as anartform on the grounds that no artworks belong to it, and that thequestion of whether or not a thing belongs to an artform arises onlybecause there is a prior reason for thinking that the thing is anartwork. So determining whether a practice is an artform requiresdetermining that its elements are artworks.  Art, therefore, seemsconceptually prior to artforms. An account of thecomplex <em>analysandum</em> artform seems to require an analysis ofeach component&mdash;an analysis of what it is to bean <em>art</em>form no less than an analysis of what it is to be anart<em>form</em> (Adajian 2012). </p><p>A sixth sort of objection rejects the project of defining art as anunwitting (and confused) expression of a harmful ideology. On thisview, the search for a definition of art presupposes, wrongly, thatthe concept of the aesthetic is a creditable one. But since theconcept of the aesthetic necessarily involves the equally bankruptconcept of disinterestedness, its deployment advances the illusionthat what is most real about things can and should be grasped orcontemplated without attending to the social and economic conditionsof their production. Definitions of art, consequently, spuriouslyconfer ontological dignity and respectability on social phenomena thatprobably in fact call more properly for rigorous social criticism andchange. Their real function is ideological, not philosophical (Eagleton 1990).</p><p>A seventh argument against defining art, with a normative tinge thatis psychologistic rather than sociopolitical, takes the fact thatthere is no philosophical consensus about the definition of art asreason to hold that no unitary concept of art exists.  Concepts ofart, like all concepts, after all, should be used for the purpose(s)they best serve.  But not all concepts of art serve all purposesequally well. So not all art concepts should be used for the samepurposes.  Art should be defined only if there is a unitary concept ofart that serves all of art&rsquo;s various purposes&mdash;historical,conventional, aesthetic, appreciative, communicative, and so on.  So,since there is no purpose-independent use of the concept of art, artshould not be defined (Mag Uidhir and Magnus 2011; cf. Meskin 2008).In response, it is noted that an account of what makes variousconcepts of art concepts of <em>art</em> is still required, whichleaves open the possibility of important commonalities. The fact (ifit is one) that different concepts of art are used for differentpurposes does not itself imply that they are not connected insystematic, ordered ways.  The relation between (say) the historicalconcept of art and the appreciative concept of art is not anaccidental, unsystematic relation, like that between river banks andsavings banks, but is something like the relation between Socrates&rsquo;healthiness and the healthiness of Socrates&rsquo; diet.  That is, it is notevident that there exist a multiplicity of art concepts, constitutingan unsystematic patchwork. Perhaps there is a single concept of artwith different facets that interlock in an ordered way, or else amultiplicity of concepts that constitute a unity because one is at thecore, and the others depend on it, but not conversely. (The last is aninstance of core-dependent homonymy; see the entry on <a href="../aristotle/">Aristotle</a>, section on Essentialismand Homonymy.) Multiplicity alone doesn&rsquo;t entail pluralism. </p><h3><a name="SomDes">3.1 Some descendants</a></h3><p>Philosophers influenced by the moderate Wittgensteinian stricturesdiscussed above have offered family resemblance accounts of art, which,as they purport to be non-definitions, may be usefully considered atthis point. Two species of family resemblance views will be considered:the resemblance-to-a-paradigm version, and the clusterversion.</p><p>On the resemblance-to-a-paradigm version, something is, or isidentifiable as, an artwork if it resembles, in the right way, certainparadigm artworks, which possess most although not necessarily all ofart&rsquo;s typical features. (The &ldquo;is identifiable&rdquo;qualification is intended to make the family resemblance view somethingmore epistemological than a definition, although it is unclear thatthis really avoids a commitment to constitutive claims aboutart&rsquo;s nature.) Against this view: since things do notresemble each other <em>simpliciter</em>, but only in at least onerespect or other, the account is either far too inclusive, sinceeverything resembles everything else in some respect or other, or, ifthe variety of resemblance is specified, tantamount to a definition,since resemblance in that respect will be either a necessary orsufficient condition for being an artwork. The family resemblanceview raises questions, moreover, about the membership and unity of theclass of paradigm artworks. If the account lacks an explanation of whysome items and not others go on the list of paradigm works, it seemsexplanatorily deficient. But if it includes a principle that governsmembership on the list, or if expertise is required to constitute thelist, then the principle, or whatever properties the experts&rsquo;judgments track, seem to be doing the philosophical work.</p><p>The cluster version of the family resemblance view has been defendedby a number of philosophers (Gaut 2000, Dissanayake 1990, Dutton2006). The view typically provides a list of properties, no one ofwhich is a necessary condition for being a work of art, but which arejointly sufficient for being a work of art, and which is such that atleast one proper subset thereof is sufficient for being a work ofart. Lists offered vary, but overlap considerably. Here is one: (1)possessing positive aesthetic properties; (2) being expressive ofemotion; (3) being intellectually challenging; (4) being formallycomplex and coherent; (5) having the capacity to convey complexmeanings; (6) exhibiting an individual point of view; (7) beingoriginal; (8) being an artifact or performance which is the product ofa high degree of skill; (9) belonging to an established artistic form;(10) being the product of an intention to make a work of art (Gaut2000). The cluster account has been criticized on several grounds.First, given its logical structure, it is in fact equivalent to along, complicated, but finite, disjunction, which makes it difficultto see why it isn&rsquo;t a definition (Davies 2006). Second, if the listof properties is incomplete, as some cluster theorists hold, then somejustification or principle would be needed for extending it.  Third,the inclusion of the ninth property on the list, <em>belonging to anestablished art form</em>, seems to invite, rather than answer, thedefinitional question. Finally, it is worth noting that, althoughcluster theorists stress what they take to be the motley nature of theclass of artworks, they tend with surprising regularity to appealtacitly to a unifying principle that unites the properties they put forwardas non-definitional. One cluster theorist, for example, gives a listvery similar to the one discussed above (it includesrepresentational properties, expressiveness, creativity, exhibiting ahigh degree of skill, belonging to an established artform), but omitsaesthetic properties on the grounds that it is the combination of theother items on the list which, combined in the experience of the workof art, are precisely the aesthetic qualities of the work (Dutton2006). Gaut, whose list is cited above, includes aesthetic propertiesas a separate item on the list, but construes them very narrowly; thedifference between these ways of formulating the cluster view appears to bemainly nominal. And an earlier cluster theorist defines artworks asall and only those things that belong to any instantiation of anartform, offers a list of seven properties all of which together areintended to capture the core of what it is to be an artform, thoughnone is either necessary or sufficient, and then claims that havingaesthetic value (of the same sort as mountains, sunsets, mathematicaltheorems) is &ldquo;what art is <em>for</em>&rdquo; (Bond 1975). </p><h2><a name="ConDef">4. Contemporary Definitions</a></h2><p>Definitions of art attempt to make sense of two different sorts offacts: art has important historically contingent cultural features, andit also, arguably, has trans-historical, trans-cultural characteristicsthat point in the direction of a relatively stable aesthetic core.(Theorists who regard art as an invention of eighteenth-century Europewill, of course, regard this way of putting the matter as tendentious,on the grounds that entities produced outside that culturallydistinctive institution do not fall under the extension of&ldquo;art&rdquo; and hence are irrelevant to the art-defining project(Shiner 2001). Whether the concept of art is precise enough to justifythis much confidence about what falls under its extension claim isunclear.) Conventionalist definitions take art&rsquo;scultural features to be explanatorily fundamental, and attempt tocapture the phenomena&mdash;revolutionary modern art, the traditionalclose connection of art with the aesthetic, the possibility ofautonomous art traditions, etc.&mdash;in social/historicalterms. Non-conventionalist or &ldquo;functionalist&rdquo;definitions reverse this explanatory order, taking a concept like theaesthetic (or some allied concept like the formal, or the expressive)as basic, and aim to account for the phenomena by working that conceptharder, perhaps extending it to non-perceptual properties.</p><h3><a name="ConDefInsHis">4.1 Conventionalist Definitions: Institutional and Historical</a></h3><p>Conventionalist definitions deny that art has essential connection toaesthetic properties, or to formal properties, or to expressiveproperties, or to any type of property taken by traditionaldefinitions to be essential to art. Conventionalist definitions havebeen strongly influenced by the emergence, in the twentieth century,of artworks that seem to differ radically from all previousartworks. Avante-garde works like Marcel Duchamp&rsquo;s&ldquo;ready-mades&rdquo;&mdash;ordinary unaltered objects likesnow-shovels (<em>In Advance of the Broken Arm</em>) and bottle-racks&mdash;conceptual works like Robert Barry&rsquo;s <em>All the things I knowbut of which I am not at the moment thinking&mdash;1:36 PM; June 15,1969</em>, and John Cage&rsquo;s <em>4&prime;33&Prime;</em>, have seemed tomany philosophers to lack or even, somehow, repudiate, the traditionalproperties of art: intended aesthetic interest, artifactuality, evenperceivability. Conventionalist definitions have also been stronglyinfluenced by the work of a number of historically-mindedphilosophers, who have documented the rise and development of modernideas of the fine arts, the individual arts, the work of art, and theaesthetic (Kristeller, Shiner, Carroll, Goehr, Kivy).</p><p>Conventionalist definitions come in two varieties, institutional andhistorical. Institutionalist conventionalism, or institutionalism, asynchronic view, typically hold that to be a work of art is to be anartifact of a kind created, by an artist, to be presented to anartworld public (Dickie 1984). Historical conventionalism, adiachronic view, holds that artworks necessarily stand in anart-historical relation to some set of earlier artworks.</p><h3><a name="InsDef">4.2 Institutional Definitions</a></h3><p>The groundwork for institutional definitions was laid by Arthur Danto,better known to non-philosophers as the long-time influential artcritic for the <em>Nation</em>. Danto coined the term&ldquo;artworld&rdquo;, by which he meant &ldquo;an atmosphere of arttheory.&rdquo; Danto&rsquo;s definition has been glossed as follows:something is a work of art if and only if (i) it has a subject (ii)about which it projects some attitude or point of view (has a style)(iii) by means of rhetorical ellipsis (usually metaphorical) whichellipsis engages audience participation in filling in what is missing,and (iv) where the work in question and the interpretations thereofrequire an art historical context (Danto, Carroll).  Clause (iv) iswhat makes the definition institutionalist.  The view has beencriticized for entailing that art criticism written in a highlyrhetorical style is art, lacking but requiring an independent accountof what makes a context <em>art historical</em>, and for not applyingto music. </p><p>The most prominent and influential institutionalism is that of GeorgeDickie. Dickie&rsquo;s institutionalism has evolved over time. According toan early version, a work of art is an artifact upon which someperson(s) acting on behalf of the artworld has conferred the status ofcandidate for appreciation (Dickie 1974).  The most recent versionconsists of an interlocking set of five definitions: (1) An artist isa person who participates with understanding in the making of a workof art. (2) A work of art is an artifact of a kind created to bepresented to an artworld public.  (3) A public is a set of persons themembers of which are prepared in some degree to understand an objectwhich is presented to them. (4) The artworld is the totality of allartworld systems. (5) An artworld system is a framework for thepresentation of a work of art by an artist to an artworld public(Dickie 1984). Both versions have been widelycriticized. Philosophers have objected that art created outside anyinstitution seems possible, although the definition rules it out, andthat the artworld, like any institution, seems capable of error. Ithas also been urged that the definition&rsquo;s obvious circularity isvicious, and that, given the inter-definition of the key concepts(artwork, artworld system, artist, artworld public) it lacks anyinformative way of distinguishing <em>art</em> institutions systemsfrom other, structurally similar, social institutions (D. Davies2004, pp. 248&ndash;249, mentions the&ldquo;commerceworld&rdquo;). Early on, Dickie claimed that anyone whosees herself as a member of the artworld <em>is</em> a member of theartworld: if this is true, then unless there are constraints on thekinds of things the artworld can put forward as artworks or candidateartworks, any entity can be an artwork (though not all are). Finally,Matravers has helpfully distinguished <em>strong</em>and <em>weak</em> institutionalism. Strong institutionalism holds thatthere is some reason that is always the reason the art institution hasfor saying that something is a work of art. Weak institutionalismholds that, for every work of art, there is some reason or other thatthe institution has for saying that it is a work of art (Matravers2000). Weak institutionalism, in particular, raises questions aboutart&rsquo;s unity: if nothing unifies the reasons that the artworld givesfor designating entities as artworks, the unity of the class ofartworks is vanishingly small.</p><h3><a name="HisDef">4.3 Historical Definitions</a></h3><p>Historical definitions hold that what characterizes artworks isstanding in some specified art-historical relation to some specifiedearlier artworks, and disavow any commitment to a trans-historicalconcept of art, or the &ldquo;artish.&rdquo; Historical definitionscome in several varieties. All of them are, or resemble, inductivedefinitions: they claim that certain entities belong unconditionallyto the class of artworks, while others do so because they stand in theappropriate relations thereto. According to the best known version,Levinson&rsquo;s intentional-historical definition, an artwork is a thingthat has been seriously intended for regard in any way preexisting orprior artworks are or were correctly regarded (Levinson 1990). Asecond version, historical functionalism says that an item is anartwork at time <em>t</em>, where <em>t</em> is not earlier than thetime at which the item is made, if and only if it is in one of thecentral art forms at <em>t</em> and is made with the intention offulfilling a function art has at <em>t</em> or it is an artifact thatachieves excellence in achieving such a function (Stecker 2005). Athird version, historical narrativism, comes in several varieties. Onone, a sufficient but not necessary condition for the identificationof a candidate as a work of art is the construction of a truehistorical narrative according to which the candidate was created byan artist in an artistic context with a recognized and live artisticmotivation, and as a result of being so created, it resembles at leastone acknowledged artwork (Carroll 1993). On another, more ambitiousand overtly nominalistic version of historical narrativism, somethingis an artwork if and only if (1) there are internal historicalrelations between it and already established artworks; (2) theserelations are correctly identified in a narrative; and (3) thatnarrative is accepted by the relevant experts. The experts donot <em>detect</em> that certain entities are artworks; rather, thefact that the experts assert that certain properties are significantin particular cases is constitutive of art (Stock 2003).</p><p>The similarity of these views to institutionalism is obvious, andthe criticisms offered parallel those urged against institutionalism.First, historical definitions appear to require, but lack, anyinformative characterization of art traditions (art functions, artisticcontexts, etc.) and hence any way of informatively distinguishing them(and likewise art functions, or artistic predecessors) from<em>non</em>-art traditions (non-art functions, non-artisticpredecessors). Correlatively, non-Western art, or alien, autonomousart of any kind appears to pose a problem for historical views: anyautonomous art tradition or artworks&mdash;terrestrial,extra-terrestrial, or merely possible&mdash;causally isolated fromour art tradition, is either ruled out by the definition, which seemsto be a <em>reductio</em>, or included, which concedes the existenceof a supra-historical concept of art. So, too, there could be entitiesthat for adventitious reasons are not correctly identified inhistorical narratives, although in actual fact they stand in relationsto established artworks that make them correctly <em>describable</em>in narratives of the appropriate sort.  Historical definitions entailthat such entities aren&rsquo;t artworks, but it seems more plausible to saythat they are artworks that are unidentified as such.  Second,historical definitions also require, but do not provide asatisfactory, informative account of the basis case&mdash;the firstartworks, or ur-artworks, in the case of the intentional-historicaldefinitions, or the first or central art-forms, in the case ofhistorical functionalism.  Third, nominalistic historical definitionsseem to face a version of the <em>Euthyphro</em> dilemma. For eithersuch definitions include substantive characterizations of what it isto be an expert, or they don&rsquo;t. If, on one hand, they include nocharacterization of what it is to be an expert, and hence noexplanation as to why the list of experts contains the people it does,then they imply that what makes things artworks is inexplicable.  Onthe other hand, suppose that the status of experts is substantivelygrounded, so that to be an expert is to possess some ability lacked bynon-experts (taste, say) in virtue of the possession of which they areable to discern historical connections between established artworksand candidate artworks.  Then the definition&rsquo;s claim to beinterestingly <em>historical</em> is questionable, because it makesart status a function of whatever ability it is that permits expertsto discern the art-making properties. </p><p>Defenders of historical definitions have replies. First, as regardsautonomous art traditions, it can be held that anything we wouldrecognize as an <em>art</em> tradition or an<em>artistic</em> practice would display aesthetic concerns, becauseaesthetic concerns have been central from the start, and persistedcentrally for thousands of years, in the Western art tradition. Henceit is an historical, not a conceptual truth that anything we recognizeas an art practice will centrally involve the aesthetic; it is justthat aesthetic concerns that have always dominated our art tradition(Levinson 2002). The idea here is that <em>if the reason that anythingwe&rsquo;d take to be a &Phi;-tradition would have &Psi;-concerns is thatour &Phi;-tradition has focused on &Psi;-concerns since its inception,then it is not essential to &Phi;-traditions that they have&Psi;-concerns, and &Phi; is a purely historical concept</em>. Butthis principle entails, implausibly, that every concept is purelyhistorical. Suppose that we discovered a new civilization whoseinhabitants could predict how the physical world works with greatprecision, on the basis of a substantial body of empirically acquiredknowledge that they had accumulated over centuries. The reason wewould credit them with having a <em>scientific</em> tradition mightwell be that our own scientific tradition has since its inceptionfocused on explaining things. It does not seem to follow that scienceis a purely historical concept with no essential connection toexplanatory aims. (Other theorists hold that it is historicallynecessary that art begins with the aesthetic, but deny that art&rsquo;snature is to be defined in terms of its historical unfolding (Davies1997).) Second, as to the first artworks, or the central art-forms orfunctions, some theorists hold that an account of them can only takethe form of an enumeration. Stecker takes this approach: he says thatthe account of what makes something a central art form at a given timeis, at its core, institutional, and that the central artforms can onlybe listed (Stecker 1997 and 2005). Whether relocating the list at adifferent, albeit deeper, level in the definition renders thedefinition sufficiently perspicuous is an open question. Third, as tothe <em>Euthyphro</em>-style dilemma, it might be held that thecategorial distinction between artworks and &ldquo;mere real things&rdquo; (Danto1981) explains the distinction between experts andnon-experts. Experts are able, it is said, to create new categories ofart. When created, new categories bring with them new universes ofdiscourse. New universes of discourse in turn make reasons availablethat otherwise would not be available.  Hence, on this view, it isboth the case that the experts&rsquo; say-so alone suffices to make merereal things into artworks, and also true that experts&rsquo; conferrals ofart-status have reasons (McFee 2011). </p><h3><a name="FunMaiAesDef">4.4 Functional (mainly aesthetic) definitions</a></h3><p>Functional definitions take some function(s) or intended function(s)to be definitive of artworks. Here only aesthetic definitions, whichconnect art essentially with the aesthetic&mdash;aesthetic judgments,experience, or properties&mdash;will be considered. Differentaesthetic definitions incorporate different views of aestheticproperties and judgments. See the entry on  <a href="../aesthetic-judgment/">aesthetic judgment</a>.</p><p>As noted above, some philosophers lean heavily on a distinctionbetween aesthetic properties and artistic properties, taking theformer to be perceptually striking qualities that can be directlyperceived in works, without knowledge of their origin and purpose, andthe latter to be relational properties that works possess in virtue oftheir relations to art history, art genres, etc. It is also, ofcourse, possible to hold a less restrictive view of aestheticproperties, on which aesthetic properties need not be perceptual; onthis broader view, it is unnecessary to deny that abstracta likemathematical entities and scientific laws possess aestheticproperties.)</p><p>Monroe Beardsley&rsquo;s definition holds that an artwork: &ldquo;either anarrangement of conditions intended to be capable of affording anexperience with marked aesthetic character or (incidentally) anarrangement belonging to a class or type of arrangements that istypically intended to have this capacity&rdquo; (Beardsley 1982,p. 299).  For more on Beardsley, see SEP, Beardsley&rsquo;sAesthetics)Beardsley&rsquo;s conception of aesthetic experience is Deweyan:aesthetic experiences are experiences that are complete, unified,intense experiences of the way things appear to us, and are, moreover,experiences which are controlled by the things experienced (see theentry on  <a href="../dewey-aesthetics/">Dewey&rsquo;s aesthetics</a>).   Zangwill&rsquo;s aesthetic definition of art says that something is a workof art if and only if someone had an insight that certain aestheticproperties would be determined by certain nonaesthetic properties, andfor this reason the thing was intentionally endowed with the aestheticproperties in virtue of the nonaesthetic properties as envisaged inthe insight (Zangwill 1995a,b). Aesthetic properties for Zangwill arethose judgments that are the subject of &ldquo;verdictive aestheticjudgments&rdquo; (judgements of beauty and ugliness) and&ldquo;substantive aesthetic judgements&rdquo; (e.g., of daintiness,elegance, delicacy, etc.). The latter are ways of being beautiful orugly; aesthetic in virtue of a special close relation to verdictivejudgments, which are subjectively universal. Other aestheticdefinitions are easily obtained, by grafting on a different account ofthe aesthetic. For example, one might define aesthetic properties asthose having an evaluative component, whose perception involves theperception of certain formal base properties, such as shape and color(De Clercq 2002).</p><p>Views which combine features of institutional and aestheticdefinitions also exist. Iseminger, for example, builds a definition onan account of appreciation, on which to appreciate a thing&rsquo;sbeing <em>F</em> is to find experiencing its being <em>F</em> to bevaluable in itself, and an account of aesthetic communication (which itis the function of the artworld to promote) (Iseminger 2004).Another definition that combines features of institutional andaesthetic definitions is David Davies&rsquo;. Davies adoptsNelson Goodman&rsquo;s account of symbolic functions that are aesthetic(a symbol functions aesthetically when it is syntactically dense,semantically dense, syntactically replete, and characterized bymultiple and complex reference, which he takes to clarify theconditions under which a practice of making is a practice of<em>artistic</em> making (Davies 2004; Goodman 1968).</p><p>Aesthetic definitions have been criticized for being both too narrowand too broad. They are held to be too narrow because they are unableto cover influential modern works like Duchamp&rsquo;s ready-mades andconceptual works like Robert Barry&rsquo;s <em>All the things I know but ofwhich I am not at the moment thinking&mdash;1:36 PM; June 15, 1969</em>,which appear to lack aesthetic properties. (Duchamp famously assertedthat his urinal, <em>Fountain</em>, was selected for its lack ofaesthetic features.) Aesthetic definitions are held to be too broadbecause beautifully designed automobiles, neatly manicured lawns, andproducts of commercial design are often created with the intention ofbeing objects of aesthetic appreciation, but are not artworks.Moreover, aesthetic views have been held to have trouble making senseof bad art. (see Dickie 2001, and S. Davies 2006, p. 37) Finally, moreradical doubts about aesthetic definitions center on theintelligibility and usefulness of the aesthetic. Beardsley&rsquo;s view, forexample, has been criticized by Dickie, who has also offeredinfluential criticisms of the idea of an aesthetic attitude (Dickie1965, Cohen 1973, Kivy 1975).</p><p>To these criticisms several responses have been offered. First, theless restrictive conception of aesthetic properties mentioned above,on which they may be based on non-perceptual formal properties, can bedeployed. On this view, conceptual works would have aestheticfeatures, much the same way that mathematical entities are oftenclaimed to (Shelley 2003, Carroll 2004). Second, a distinction may bedrawn between time-sensitive properties, whose standard observationconditions include an essential reference to temporal location of theobserver, and non-time-sensitive properties, which do not.Higher-order aesthetic properties like drama, humor, and irony, whichaccount for a significant part of the appeal of Duchamp&rsquo;s andCage&rsquo;s works, on this view, would derive from time-sensitiveproperties (Zemach 1997). Third, it might be held that it is the<em>creative</em> <em>act</em> of presenting something that is in therelevant sense unfamiliar, into a new context, the artworld, which hasaesthetic properties. Or, fourth, it might be held that (Zangwill&rsquo;s&ldquo;second-order&rdquo; strategy) works like ready-mades lackaesthetic functions, but are parasitic upon, because meant to beconsidered in the context of, works that do have aesthetic functions,and therefore constitute mere borderline cases. Finally, it can beflatly denied that the ready-mades were works of art (Beardsley1982).</p><p>As to the over-inclusiveness of aesthetic definitions, a distinctionmight be drawn between primary and secondary functions. Or it may bemaintained that some cars, lawns, and products of industrial design areon the art/non-art borderline, and so don&rsquo;t constitute clearand decisive counter-examples. Or, if the claim that aesthetic theoriesfail to account for bad art depends on holding that some works haveabsolutely <em>no</em> aesthetic value whatsoever, as opposed to somenon-zero amount, however infinitesimal, it may be wondered whatjustifies that assumption. </p><h2><a name="Con">5. Conclusion</a></h2><p>Conventionalist definitions account well for modern art, but havedifficulty accounting for art&rsquo;s universality&mdash;especially thefact that there can be art disconnected from &ldquo;our&rdquo;(Western) institutions and traditions, and our species.  They alsostruggle to account for the fact that the same aesthetic terms areroutinely applied to artworks, natural objects, humans, and abstracta.Aesthetic definitions do better accounting for art&rsquo;s traditional,universal features, but less well, at least according to their critics, withrevolutionary modern art; their further defense requires an account ofthe aesthetic which can be extended in a principled way to conceptualand other radical art. (An aesthetic definition and a conventionalistone could simply be conjoined. But that would merely raise, withoutanswering, the fundamental question of the unity or disunity of theclass of artworks.) Which defect is the more serious one depends onwhich <em>explananda</em> are the more important. Arguments at thislevel are hard to come by, because positions are hard to motivate inways that do not depend on prior conventionalist and functionalistsympathies. If list-like definitions are flawed because uninformative,then so are conventionalist definitions, whether institutional orhistorical. Of course, if the class of artworks is a mere chaoticheap, lacking any genuine unity, then enumerative definitions cannotbe faulted for being uninformative: they do all the explaining that itis possible to do, because they capture all the unity that there is tocapture. In that case the worry articulated by one prominentaesthetician, who wrote earlier of the &ldquo;bloated, unwieldy&rdquo;concept of art which institutional definitions aim to capture, needsto be taken seriously, even if it turns out to be ungrounded:&ldquo;It is not at all clear that these words&mdash;&lsquo;What isart?&rsquo;&mdash;express anything like a single question, to whichcompeting answers are given, or whether philosophers proposing answersare even engaged in the same debate&hellip;.  The sheer variety ofproposed definitions should give us pause. One cannot help wonderingwhether there is any sense in which they are attempts to &hellip;clarify the same cultural practices, or address the same issue.&rdquo;(Walton 1977, 2007) </p></div><div id="bibliography"><h2><a name="Bib">Bibliography</a></h2><ul class="hanging"><li>Adajian, Thomas, 2005, &ldquo;On the Prototype Theory of Conceptsand the Definition of Art,&rdquo; <em>Journal of Aesthetics and ArtCriticism</em>, 63: 231&ndash;236.</li><li>&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;, 2012, &ldquo;Defining Art,&rdquo; inA.
