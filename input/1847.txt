At altitudes up to 250,000 feet,the atmosphere consists of approximately 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen. The remainder ismade up of argon, carbon dioxide, several other gases, and water vapor. Water vapor actsas an independent gas mixed with air.</font></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Water vapor is found only in the lowerlevels of the atmosphere. From the standpoint of weather, however, it is the mostimportant component of the air. Because it can change into water droplets or ice crystalsunder atmospheric conditions of temperature and pressure, water vapor is responsible forthe formation of clouds and fog. However, just when and under what conditions water vaporwill change to a visible form is difficult to predict and is made more difficult by thefact that the amount of water vapor in the air is never constant, but varies from day today and even from hour to hour.</font></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The lower layer of the atmosphere containsan enormous number of microscopic impurities such as salt, dust and smoke particles. Theyare important to aviation for they are often present in sufficient quantities to reducevisibility. They also have a function in the condensation process.</font></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The upper layers of the atmosphere do notcontain dust particles or impurities for the sun's light to reflect off, and for thisreason appear deep cobalt blue to black in color.</font></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The <a href="flight21.htm">atmosphere hasweight</a>.

These characteristics are ofthe utmost importance in a study of weather for they in combination are the cause ofalmost all atmospheric weather phenomena. The capacity for expansion is especiallyimportant. Air is often forced to rise by various lifting agents (thermal, frontal ormechanical means). Rising in areas of decreasing pressure, the parcel of air expands. Inexpanding, it cools. The cooling process may bring the temperature of the parcel of air tothe degree where condensation occurs. Thus clouds form and precipitation may take place.Conversely, sinking air, as the external pressure increases, decreases in volume with anattendant rise in temperature.</font></p><p><br></p><p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">DIVISIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE</font></strong> </p><blockquote>  <table align="left">    <tr>      <td><p align="right"><img border="0" src="/web/20090421144658im_/http://www.allstar.fiu.edu/aero/images/pic2-0.gif" width="239" height="613"></td>    </tr>  </table>  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The atmosphere consists of four distinct  layers surrounding the earth for a depth of many hundreds of miles. They are, in ascending  order, the troposphere, the stratosphere, the mesosphere and the thermosphere.</font></p>  <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong><a name="troposphere">THE  TROPOSPHERE</a></strong></em>. This is the lowest layer of the atmosphere, and varies in  height in different spans of the world from roughly 28,000 feet above sea level at the  poles to 54,000 feet at the equator. Within the troposphere the pressure, density and  temperature all decrease rapidly with height. Most of the weather occurs in the  troposphere, because of the presence of water vapor and strong vertical currents.&nbsp; In  the upper regions of the troposphere, winds are strong and the fast moving jet streams  occur.&nbsp; The top layer of the troposphere is known as the <em>tropopause</em>.&nbsp;  Here the temperature ceases to drop and remains substantially constant at about  -56�C.&nbsp; The height of the tropopause varies, as already stated, from the poles to  the equator, but also from summer to winter.</font></p>  <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><em><a name="stratosphere">THE  STRATOSPHERE</a></em></strong>. For a distance of about 50,000 feet above the tropopause,  there is a layer known as the <em>stratosphere</em> in which the pressure continues to  decrease but in which the temperature remains relatively constant in the vicinity of  -56�C. This layer also varies in thickness, being quite deep over the poles and thinner  over the equator.&nbsp; Water vapor is almost non-existent and air currents are  minimal.&nbsp; The top layer of the stratosphere is called the <em>stratopause</em>.</font></p>  <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>THE MESOSPHERE</strong></em>.  The mesosphere is characterized by a marked increase in temperature.&nbsp; At a height of  about 150,000 feet, the temperature reaches 10�C.&nbsp; The rise in temperature is due to  the presence of a layer of ozone which absorbs more of the sun's radiation.&nbsp; In the  top layer of the mesosphere, called the <em>mesopause</em>, the temperature again drops  rapidly reaching a level of about -100�C at 250,000 feet above the earth. </font></p>  <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong><a name="thermosphere">THE  THERMOSPHERE</a></strong></em>. Temperature again begins to rise in the thermosphere and  increases for an indefinite distance into space, rising as high as 3000�C at 400  miles.&nbsp; This does not mean that a space ship, if it was cruising at this height,  would experience a temperature of 3000�C by contact with the atmosphere.&nbsp; The  temperature in these rarified layers is based on the kinetic theory of gases.&nbsp; The  only heat the space ship would experience would be what it would receive from the  radiation of the sun.&nbsp; The spectacular auroras form in the upper regions of the  thermosphere. Within the thermosphere is a region known as the <em>ionosphere</em>, which  extends from about 50 miles to 250 miles above the earth's surface.&nbsp; Within this  region, free electron density is very great and distance from Sea Level affects radio  communication.&nbsp; The ionosphere is the layer which reflects low and medium frequency  radio waves back to the earth.&nbsp; Very high frequency (VHF) radio waves, however,  penetrate this layer.&nbsp; Beyond the ionosphere lies a layer so thin that the pressure  drops to little more than a vacuum.&nbsp; Under these conditions, the concept of  temperature has little meaning and is usually replaced by definitions of the energy states  of individual molecules.&nbsp; This thin upper layer is known as the <em>exosphere</em>.</font></p>  <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><em>SPACE</em></strong>.
