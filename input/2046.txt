As an expert in primate evolution, she decided to discuss the 					evolution of skin color, but when she went through the literature on 					the subject she was dismayed. Some theories advanced before the 1970s 					tended to be racist, and others were less than convincing. White skin, 					for example, was reported to be more resistant to cold weather, although 					groups like the Inuit are both dark and particularly resistant to cold. 					After the 1970s, when researchers were presumably more aware of the 					controversy such studies could kick up, there was very little work at 					all. "It's one of these things everybody notices," Jablonski says, "but 					nobody wants to talk about."</p>										<p>No longer. Jablonski and her husband, George Chaplin, a geographic 					information systems specialist, have formulated the first comprehensive 					theory of skin color. Their findings, published in a recent issue of the 					<i>Journal of Human Evolution</i>, show a strong, somewhat predictable 					correlation between skin color and the strength of sunlight across the 					globe. But they also show a deeper, more surprising process at work: 					Skin color, they say, is largely a matter of vitamins.</p>										<p>Jablonski, now chairman of the anthropology department at the 					California Academy of Sciences, begins by assuming that our earliest 					ancestors had fair skin just like chimpanzees, our closest biological 					relatives. Between 4.5 million and 2 million years ago, early humans 					moved from the rain forest and onto the East African savanna. Once on 					the savanna, they not only had to cope with more exposure to the sun, 					but they also had to work harder to gather food. Mammalian brains are 					particularly vulnerable to overheating: A change of only five or six 					degrees can cause a heatstroke. So our ancestors had to develop a 					better cooling system.</p>										<p>The answer was sweat, which dissipates heat through evaporation. 					Early humans probably had few sweat glands, like chimpanzees, and those 					were mainly located on the palms of their hands and the bottoms of their 					feet. Occasionally, however, individuals were born with more glands than 					usual. The more they could sweat, the longer they could forage before the 					heat forced them back into the shade. The more they could forage, the 					better their chances of having healthy offspring and of passing on their 					sweat glands to future generations.</p>										<p>A million years of natural selection later, each human has about 					2 million sweat glands spread across his or her body. Human skin, being 					less hairy than chimpanzee skin, "dries much quicker," says Adrienne 					Zihlman, an anthropologist at the University of California at Santa Cruz. 					"Just think how after a bath it takes much longer for wet hair to dry."</p>										<p>Hairless skin, however, is particularly vulnerable to damage from 					sunlight. Scientists long assumed that humans evolved melanin, the main 					determinant of skin color, to absorb or disperse ultraviolet light. But 					what is it about ultraviolet light that melanin protects against? Some 					researchers pointed to the threat of skin cancer. But cancer usually 					develops late in life, after a person has already reproduced. Others 					suggested that sunburned nipples would have hampered breast-feeding. 					But a slight tan is enough to protect mothers against that problem.</p>										<p>During her preparation for the lecture in Australia, Jablonski 					found a 1978 study that examined the effects of ultraviolet light on 					folate, a member of the vitamin B complex. An hour of intense sunlight, 					the study showed, is enough to cut folate levels in half if your skin 					is light. Jablonski made the next, crucial connection only a few weeks 					later. At a seminar on embryonic development, she heard that low folate 					levels are correlated with neural-tube defects such as spina bifida and 					anencephaly, in which infants are born without a full brain or spinal 					cord.</p>										<img src="/web/20130216070146im_/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/07/3/images/l_073_04.jpg" width="400" height="228" border="0" alt="Predicted skin colors of indigenous people of the world">										<p><b>Jablonski and Chaplin predicted the skin colors of indigenous 					people across the globe based on how much ultraviolet light different 					areas receive.</b> Graphic by Matt Zang, adapted from the data of N. 					Jablonski and G. Chaplin</p>										<p>Jablonski later came across three documented cases in which 					children's neural-tube defects were linked to their mothers' visits 					to tanning studios during early pregnancy. Moreover, she found that 					folate is crucial to sperm development -- so much so that a folate 					inhibitor was developed as a male contraceptive. ("It never got 					anywhere," Jablonski says. "It was so effective that it knocked out 					all folate in the body.") She now had some intriguing evidence that 					folate might be the driving force behind the evolution of darker skin. 					But why do some people have light skin?</p>										<p>As far back as the 1960s, the biochemist W. Farnsworth Loomis 					had suggested that skin color is determined by the body's need for 					vitamin D. The vitamin helps the body absorb calcium and deposit it 					in bones, an essential function, particularly in fast-growing embryos. 					(The need for vitamin D during pregnancy may explain why women around 					the globe tend to have lighter skin than men.) Unlike folate, vitamin D 					depends on ultraviolet light for its production in the body. Loomis 					believed that people who live in the north, where daylight is weakest, 					evolved fair skin to help absorb more ultraviolet light and that people 					in the tropics evolved dark skin to block the light, keeping the body 					from overdosing on vitamin D, which can be toxic at high concentrations.</p>										<p>By the time Jablonski did her research, Loomis's hypothesis 					had been partially disproved. "You can never overdose on natural 					amounts of vitamin D," Jablonski says. "There are only rare cases 					where people take too many cod-liver supplements." But Loomis's 					insight about fair skin held up, and it made a perfect complement 					for Jablonski's insight about folate and dark skin. The next step 					was to find some hard data correlating skin color to light levels.</p>										<p>Until the 1980s, researchers could only estimate how much 					ultraviolet radiation reaches Earth's surface. But in 1978, NASA 					launched the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer. Three years ago, 					Jablonski and Chaplin took the spectrometer's global ultraviolet 					measurements and compared them with published data on skin color in 					indigenous populations from more than 50 countries. To their delight, 					there was an unmistakable correlation: The weaker the ultraviolet 					light, the fairer the skin. Jablonski went on to show that people 					living above 50 degrees latitude have the highest risk of vitamin D 					deficiency. "This was one of the last barriers in the history of human 					settlement," Jablonski says. "Only after humans learned fishing, and 					therefore had access to food rich in vitamin D, could they settle 					these regions."</p>										<p>Humans have spent most of their history moving around. To do 					that, they've had to adapt their tools, clothes, housing, and 					eating habits to each new climate and landscape. But Jablonski's 					work indicates that our adaptations go much further. People in the 					tropics have developed dark skin to block out the sun and protect 					their body's folate reserves. People far from the equator have 					developed fair skin to drink in the sun and produce adequate amounts 					of vitamin D during the long winter months.</p>										<p>Jablonski hopes that her research will alert people to the 					importance of vitamin D and folate in their diet. It's already 					known, for example, that dark-skinned people who move to cloudy 					climes can develop conditions such as rickets from vitamin D 					deficiencies. More important, Jablonski hopes her work will begin 					to change the way people think about skin color. "We can take a 					topic that has caused so much disagreement, so much suffering, 					and so much misunderstanding," she says, "and completely disarm it."</p>					<p style="font-size:10px;">(From <i>Discover,</i> Vol. 22, No. 2, February, 2001.
