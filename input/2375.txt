Farmers are at very       high risk for fatal and nonfatal injuries. Farming is one of the few industries       in which the families (who often share the work and live on the premises)       are also at risk for fatal and nonfatal injuries.       <ul>        <li>Approximately 1,842,000 full-time workers were employed in production           agriculture in the U.S. in 2005.<br/>          <br/>        </li>        <li>An estimated 1.26 million children and adolescents under 20 years           of age resided on farms in 2004, with about 699,000 of these youth performing           work on the farms. In addition to the youth who live on farms, an additional          337,000 children and adolescents were hired to work on U.S. farms in           2004.</li>        <br/>        <br/>        <li>On average, 103 children are killed annually on farms (1990-1996).           Approximately 40 percent of these deaths were work-related.</li>        <br/>        <br/>        <li>In 2004, an estimated 27,600 children and adolescents were injured           on farms; 8,100 of these injuries were due to farm work.<br/>          <br/>        </li>        <li>In an average year, 516  workers die doing farm work in the U.S. (1992-2005). Of these deaths, 101 are caused by  tractor overturns.</li>        <br/>        <br/>        <li>Every day, about 243 agricultural workers suffer lost-work-time injuries,           and about 5&#37; of these result in permanent impairment.</li>      </ul>      <p>In FY 1990, Congress directed NIOSH to develop an extensive agricultural               safety and health program to address the high risks of injuries               and illnesses experienced by workers and families in agriculture.               NIOSH funds research and prevention programs at university centers               in 20 states. These programs conduct research on injuries associated               with different farm operations, as well as pesticide exposure, pulmonary               disease, musculoskeletal disorders, hearing loss, and stress.</p>      <h3><a name="nioshtic2" id="nioshtic2"></a>NIOSHTIC-2 Search</h3>      <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071028181205/http://www2.cdc.gov/nioshtic-2/BuildQyr.asp?s1=violence&amp;f1=TI&amp;t1=1&amp;s2=violence&amp;f2=KW&amp;t2=1&amp;s3=homicide*&amp;f3=TI&amp;t3=1&amp;s4=homicide*&amp;f4=KW&amp;B1=Search&amp;terms=4&amp;Adv=1&amp;n=new&amp;View=b&amp;Startyear=&amp;EndYear=&amp;Limit=500&amp;D1=10&amp;Sort=DP+DESC"><strong>NIOSHTIC-2 search results on Agricultural Safety </strong></a><br/>      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071028181205/http://www2a.cdc.gov/nioshtic-2/">NIOSHTIC-2</a> is a searchable bibliographic database of occupational safety and health publications, documents, grant reports, and journal articles supported in whole or in part by the NIOSH.</p>      <h3><a name="pubsandwebs" id="pubsandwebs"></a>Selected NIOSH Publications and Web sites         on Agricultural Safety</h3>      <p><a href="/web/20071028181205/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nas/agforfish/"><strong>National Academies NIOSH Program Review: Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing</strong><br/>      </a>This report is the initial �evidence package� from NIOSH to the Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing Research Program evaluation committee assembled by the NA.

These workers received         serious skin burns and other injuries when the drill bits penetrated the         frames releasing and igniting flammable gases. Hydrogen and methane gas         may be produced within sealed frames that are filled during manufacture         with scrap metal ballast. Although the reported ignitions involved plows         from the same manufacturer, the use of scrap metal fill may not be unique         to plows or to that manufacturer. The potential for such ignitions exists         in any equipment with similar ballast in sealed compartments during drilling,         cutting, welding, or other operations that both release the gases and         provide an ignition source.

The grain auger is an         essential piece of farm equipment which is used to move grain from one         location to another. However, every year accidents occur when this piece         of equipment is improperly moved in the elevated position and it comes         into contact with high voltage power lines. This has resulted in one or         more fatalities per incident.
