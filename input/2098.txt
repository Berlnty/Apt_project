molecular anthropologist who teaches at                 the University of North Carolina-Charlotte. He is author of </i>Human                 Biodiversity<i> and </i>What It Means to Be 98% Chimpanzee<i>.</i>              <p><b>What are the conventional, popular understandings of race?</b>              <p>The folk understanding of race                 is that there's a small number of basically different kinds of                 people, perhaps localized to continents: Asians, Africans, Europeans,                 Australians, Native Americans. But the idea is that there's a                 small number of basically different flavors of people, perhaps                 color-coded for your convenience: yellow, white, red, black. That's                 the common sense understanding of race. <p>This doesn't reflect                 natural patterns of variation, because of course, the peoples                 of Africa are exceedingly diverse, the peoples of Asia are exceedingly                 diverse, and the peoples of Europe, of course, are exceedingly                 diverse, as well. <p>So it's not that we're reading natural patterns                 of variation and simply extracting this idea from nature, but                 what we're doing is we're deciding that certain patterns of variation                 are less important that others, and certain patterns of variation                 are more important that others. We decide that the difference                 between a Norwegian and an Italian is not significant and so we'll                 place them in the same category. And we decide that the difference                 between a Persian and a Somali is important; and so we'll place                 them in different categories.               <p><b>What does genetics tell us about human variation?</b>              <p>The modern study of genetic variation, since                 about the 1970s, tells us essentially that people are similar                 to those nearby and they're different from those far away. And                 that no more tells us that there's three kinds of people than                 it tells us there are seven, or twelve, or thirty-eight kinds                 of people. Most genetic variation is encapsulated within any local                 group - that is to say, all human groups have people that are                 taller, or shorter, or heavier, or skinnier, or more extroverted                 or more introverted. <p>So the range of different kinds of people                 are found within all groups and what genetics was able to do was                 to put a number on that. About 85% of detectable genetic variation                 is located within groups. To the extent that there is between-group                 variation, the majority of between-group variation is local, not                 racial. And the amount of difference attributable to this large                 group of people versus that large group of people is only a tiny                 portion of the total of human variation.               <p><b>What accounts for our patterns of variation? </b>              <p>The peoples of east Africa look                 different from the peoples of western Africa, who look different                 from the peoples of South Africa. And in fact, the peoples of                 east Africa look more like the peoples of west Asia, and are genetically                 more similar to the peoples of west Asia than they are to the                 peoples of western Africa. Why is that? Because they're closer.                 And the major variable determining biological similarity and biological                 difference is geographical proximity. Why? Because people interbreed                 with one another. And when human groups come into contact with                 each other, what Cole Porter called "the urge to merge" has invariably                 expressed itself. It didn't start with Columbus. It's been going                 on through time immemorial.<p>Neighboring groups always have complex                 economic and social relationships with their neighbors, and obviously                 they marry their neighbors and they have complex forms of what                 anthropologists used to sexistly call "bride exchange." We may                 hate the people next door, but we're related to them. Why? Because                 our ancestors interbred.<p>Throughout European history we certainly                 know about all kinds of migrations and invasions and dispersions.                 We know less about the history of pre-colonial Africa, because                 we have less preserved in writing, but that certainly doesn't                 mean that people were just sitting there in one place. Obviously                 people were migrating and people were moving and the history of                 populations is a dynamic, flowing continuum. And that's why the                 patterns that we discovered genetically - the continuity of form,                 and the continuity of populations from place to place exists -                 because people are always moving and interbreeding and intermarrying.<p>There's                 two major kinds of gene flow. One would be a large-scale invasion                 or migration. The other kind would be population A intermarries                 with population B, population B intermarries with population C,                 population C intermarries with population D. And of course, this                 way genes from here can move a long distance over long periods                 of time, depending upon the amount of interbreeding that goes                 on. We know it happens, and it happens everywhere. It happened                 even in the Pleistocene. Neanderthals had trade routes and where                 goods flow, obviously genes flow as well. Those traveling salesman                 jokes were probably there back in the Pleistocene as well.<p>We                 used to think that human history consisted of population branching                 and was always divergent. These people moved here and stayed here,                 and then those people moved over there and stayed over there,                 and this group moved over there and stayed over there. That's                 incredibly simplistic because what we know is that human evolution                 is not constantly divergent, human evolution is reticulated -                 that is to say, it's like the capillaries in a blood stream. They                 branch apart, they come back together. These people go over here                 and they encounter and interbreed with others.               <p><b>What is non-concordance and what does it tell us about race?                 </b>              <p>By non-concordance, what                 we mean is that different individual traits in the human species                 don't share the same patterns of variation across geographic space..                 Skin color for example, varies with latitude. Certain people have                 brown hair and blue eyes. Other people have blond hair and blue                 eyes. And even though there's a statistical association of those                 particular features, they're not invariably expressed with one                 another. Certainly dark skin is present all over the world in                 different populations. Indigenous Australians, indigenous peoples                 of India, indigenous peoples of Africa are all very darkly pigmented                 even though they're not particularly closely related. And one                 of the interesting problems with the theory of race is that if                 you look at the peoples of, for example, the Indian sub-continent,                 you find people who are darkly pigmented like Africans, have hair                 like East Asians, and facially resemble Europeans. They live on                 the continent of Asia. What do you do with these people? <p>Traits                 are non-concordant because genes are inherited independently of                 one another to a large extent. We can look at patterns of body                 parts and patterns of body form, but it's very hard to associate                 specific genetic patterns with specific body patterns. Interestingly                 though, we generally find the same geographical patterns whether                 we look at bodies or whether we look at genes. And that pattern                 is that most variation is within the group. We don't find large                 clusters of relatively homogeneous people.               <p><b>What are clines?</b>              <p>In                 anthropology we talk about clinal variation. Cline is a term that                 was devised by the biologist Julian Huxley to represent a geographical                 gradient in a particular trait across a species. So if you've                 got a broadly distributed species that has a particular form,                 whether it's body shape or color - let's say in the north it looks                 different from the south but they're the same species - you can't                 really draw a line and say there's two kinds of frogs that have                 this or that particular form. Instead, the variation is gradual                 and continuous. What Huxley argued is that we should talk not                 about discrete racial variation, but about gradual clinal variation.                 And about 30 years after Huxley proposed the term clines, anthropologists                 came to recognize that pretty much all variation in the human                 species is clinal - that is to say, continuous and gradual across                 geography, and not discrete, not racial.<p>When anthropologist                 Frank Livingston wrote in the early 1960s "There are no races,                 there are only clines," what he was doing was summarizing epigrammatically                 what anthropologists had come to realize since about World War                 II, with the work of Ashley Montagu: that the human species simply                 doesn't come patterned the way we thought it came patterned, and                 that the way we were thinking about natural patterns of human                 variation was really topsy-turvy.              <p><b>What is wrong with the claim that some 'races' are naturally                 better athletes?</b>              <p>A person's                 accomplishments are obviously a consequence, to some extent, of                 the abilities that they have. If you didn't have the ability to                 do something, you couldn't do it. But the fact that you didn't                 do it, the fact that you didn't accomplish something, doesn't                 necessarily mean you didn't have the ability to do it. It simply                 means that for whatever reason, it didn't happen. So there's a                 basic asymmetry here between, on the one hand, the observation                 of a performance, and the inference of an ability from the observation                 of that performance. If the performance exists, you know the ability                 existed. But if the performance doesn't exist, you can't tell                 if the ability didn't exist. <p>Yet there's this wonderful fallacy                 out there that I can compare what groups of people accomplish                 and somehow infer what groups of people are capable of, or what                 they're not capable of. And so there's this argument, for example,                 that because blacks are so overrepresented in the NBA, and so                 underrepresented in the AMA it means that they're really talented                 at basketball and not so talented at medicine. That this disparity                 is somehow a reflection of their underlying natural abilities                 is simply a fallacy because we can't draw a conclusion about underlying                 abilities from observations of performance. <p>If we could infer                 the existence of innate basketball talent, innate basketball ability,                 from the observation of the overrepresentation of blacks in the                 NBA, we then have to infer the existence of comedy genes in Jews                 by virtue of the overrepresentation of Jews in comedy. Or the                 overrepresentation of Irish in the police force. Obviously there                 are all kinds of factors that go into occupational specializations                 and they're not necessarily reflections of underlying abilities.                 If we don't have a scientific way to study underlying abilities,                 we shouldn't be talking about it as if it's scientific discourse,                 because it's not. It might be fun to talk about at a bar, but                 it's not scientific discourse.<p>As scientists, we can only study                 what we can measure. And we can only measure performances. That's                 all we have access to. We can't measure abilities. <p>Every performance                 occurs within a context of a lived life, and the conditions of                 growth and development and nutrition. Now, a successful performance                 obviously involves things like training and coaching, psyching                 out, teamwork, nutrition, the conditions of growth, your own self-image,                 what you think you're good at. And unless we can control these                 kinds of variables, we simply can't look at, say, the success                 of East African marathoners as evidence for East African native                 ability in running. It's not to say that East Africans don't have                 native abilities. But the onus is on people who declare that there                 is some sort of natural ability to be able to tell us exactly                 where they see natural ability, and how they know it's not caused                 by other things. If you have many causes and one effect, it's                 unscientific to simply say, "I isolate one of these causes without                 doing appropriate controls." That's why we do controls in science.                 <p>If you go back to the record books, you find many prominent                 Jewish basketball players in the 1940s. You go to the 1910s, 1920s,                 in both America and in London there were many prominent Jewish                 boxers. Where are the great Jewish boxers today? I mean it, it                 almost sounds like a contradiction in terms, "great Jewish boxer."                 Where are the Jewish boxers today? Well, they're in medical school.                 That wasn't an option in the 1920s. <p>As doors open that enable                 different populations to rise socioeconomically, and go into the                 middle class, boxing is a less attractive option. If you're a                 parent, having your son beat up for a living just isn't that attractive                 a job to encourage your child to go into if you perceive that                 there are other options open to him. If you perceive that there                 aren't other options open to him, it's certainly as good as anything                 else. And that's why of course, something like boxing is very                 much class dominated. Which is not to say that there are no boxers                 from other socioeconomic groups. But it's a sport that has traditionally                 been drawn from the lower socioeconomic classes. Why? They don't                 perceive they have other options in life.              <p><b>What is the relationship between Social Darwinism and eugenics?</b>              <p>After Darwin wrote The                 Origin of Species and pretty much convinced the scientific community                 that competition was the cause of diversity in the animal and                 plant world, the question was, "Well, was this similar to what                 went on in the social world?" <p>And a very heterogeneous movement                 called Social Darwinism - which appropriated the label of Darwin                 because it had scientific cache - arose, which sought to justify                 economic and social inequalities by recourse to natural patterns                 of variation. That is to say, the people at the top deserve to                 be at the top, because their natural abilities are being brought                 out, and the people at the bottom deserve to be at the bottom,                 because they suck. <p>The political implications of this were                 that if we were to develop child labor laws, welfare to aid the                 poor, etc. that would be a subversion of the natural order, because                 the natural order is the cause of the social hierarchy. The people                 at the top deserve to be at the top, the people at the bottom                 deserve to be at the bottom, and if we help the people at the                 bottom rise, well, they shouldn't be rising, because they're where                 they deserve to be. And what the Social Darwinists argued was                 for government to get off the backs of the people. They didn't                 want a government intervention in the rapacious capitalism of                 the late 19th century. They were rightly very quickly perceived                 as simply apologists for the greedy rich, and the movement pretty                 much fizzled out by the turn of the 20th century. But it was replaced                 by the idea of eugenics. <p>And what eugenics did to the Social                 Darwinist movement was to preserve one idea - namely that the                 social hierarchy is a reflection of differences in natural endowment.                 But it reversed one point very importantly. And that is instead                 of the Social Darwinists wanting government off the backs of the                 people what the eugenicists wanted was direct government intervention.                 They wanted federal laws to restrict immigration and to sterilize                 the poor against their will.<p>The ideas of eugenicists were very                 conducive to totalitarian governments in the 1920s and 1930s.                 They wanted strong centralized authority to impose their scientific                 will on the population. There was a very strong degree of utopian                 dreaming that if everybody just gave geneticists a lot of authority                 and a lot of money and stood out of the way, we would build a                 great society.              <p><b>How many "races" did traditional anthropologists come up with?                 </b>              <p>Anthropologists who originally looked at Europeans                 as a race, or a subspecies, and Africans, and Native Americans,                 and Asians, were quickly faced with the fact that Europeans don't                 all look alike. If you go from northern Europe to southern Europe,                 we now know of course, what we see as a gradient, what we see                 is a cline, or many different clines of features. But, if your                 mindset is that to analyze it scientifically, you must impose                 discrete barriers and classify it, you're faced with how do you                 break up the continuous variation in Europe into discrete groups?<p>And                 so they began to find races within races. So within the European                 race they found the Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean races: three                 discrete kinds of people that don't really exist within a larger                 group, "Caucasians" that doesn't really exist, in contrast to                 another group. So the word "race" took on this very nebulous characteristic.                 There were races within races within sub-races. In a book called                 The Races of Europe, Carlton Coon found over 20 races in Europe                 alone.<p>Of course this was the imposition of a fundamentally                 wrong-headed approach on the question of analyzing human variation.                 What they were trying to do was box it, to classify it, when what                 they needed to do was to analyze it, and study it in terms of                 asking what kinds of patterns are there, instead of assuming and                 imposing the patterns on the variation.              <p><b>What do we make of the claims of geneticists that our "natures"                 are determined by our genes?</b>              <p>One of the problems in interpreting the statements of                 geneticists even today is that 95% of everything a geneticist                 says is code for "Give me more money." Therefore, when a geneticist                 says that everything important in life is genetic, you have to                 realize that they have a conflict of interest. Why? They're geneticists.                 Of course they want you to believe that everything important in                 life is genetic, in the same way an Oldsmobile salesman tells                 you that an Oldsmobile is the best car on the road. That might                 be true, but of course they have a vested interest in your believing                 it. <p>Behavioral genetics is a wonderful endeavor. It's a really                 interesting field to be in - studying the genetic differences                 that lead to behavioral differences. But it's focused on a really,                 really small part of the pie. When we look at the differences                 in behavior that exist in the human species, we know how that's                 patterned. It's patterned in a very particular way. Most behavioral                 variation in the human species is localized between groups - that                 is to say, most behavioral variation in the human species is:                 the French eat with forks, the Chinese eat with chopsticks. The                 French use nasalized vowels, the Spanish don't. This group of                 people eats this kind of food, and considers that other kind of                 food repellent. This group of people classifies kin in this way,                 they classify their kin in a different way. These group of people                 wear saris, this group of people wear pants. <p>This is cultural                 variation. It accounts for the great majority of behavioral variation                 in the human species and we know something about it. We know it's                 caused by the circumstances of history. How do we know this? Immigrant                 studies. We know that people immigrate, and they adopt the ways                 of other people in a generation, maybe a couple of generations.                 But we know that very quickly one group of people can do what                 another group of people does and it doesn't have to do with their                 genes. <p>On the other hand, within any population, there are                 behavioral differences. There are people with different personality                 traits; some more introverted, some more extroverted; some better                 at math, some more verbally agile. These are due to a lot of different                 causes, some of which may be historical. Some of which may result                 from the circumstances of upbringing. Some may be due to nutrition.                 Some may be due to differences in genetics. <p>The important thing                 here though, is that the extent to which genetics influences behavior                 in humans has got to be a very, very small part of the spectrum                 of the range of human behavior, because the vast majority of difference                 in human behavior is not genetic in origin; it's cultural in origin.<p>One                 of the things that anthropology showed me is that even observing                 a consistent physical difference between populations is not adequate                 evidence for that difference being genetic. The fact that it's                 always there doesn't mean that it's innate. And a nice example                 of this was revealed by the anthropologist Franz Boas in the early                 part of this century, who studied variation in skull form in immigrants.<p>In                 the late 19th century, it was shown that different groups of people                 had, on the average, different shaped skulls; some longer, some                 broader. And these differences in skull shape were found to be                 very consistent and very uniform. Different populations tended                 to have similarly shaped skulls. Boas wanted to question whether                 or not skull shape was sensitive to the conditions of life.<p>And                 what Boas determined by studying immigrants to Ellis Island, from                 two different populations that were known for having different                 shaped skulls, is that after they were living in the United States                 for a considerable number of years, their skull shapes changed.                 In other words, the fact of immigration and growing up in a different                 place changed the shape of your skull.<p>This isn't a radical                 proposition. We know that the body is sensitive to the conditions                 of life, and to the conditions of development. Boas simply showed,                 in a very graphical and in a very statistical sense, that a particular                 body form that was thought to be innate, that was thought to reflect                 a constitutional genetic character - the shape of your skull -                 was, in fact, much more sensitive to the conditions of life, much                 more plastic than had previously been thought. <p>In the history                 of anthropology, what we find is that more and more traits that                 are thought to be innate - traits that are thought to be natural                 differences, because they've always been there - are more and                 more shown to be ephemeral, the results of social history.<p>What                 we need to recognize is that standards of evidence are crucial                 here. And standards of evidence now have to dictate that to infer                 a genetic basis for difference requires genetic data. Simply observing                 phenotypic differences, simply observing differences that are                 measurable in body form, or in performance are an inadequate basis                 on which to infer a difference in the genes, because patterns                 of genetic variation don't map very easily onto patterns of physical                 variation.<p><p>               <p>               <p align="right"><a href="#top"><u>&lt;BACK TO TOP</u></a></p>              </td>					</tr>				</table>			</td>			<td bgcolor="000000"></td>		</tr>	</table>	<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">	<tr>		<td><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#F3ECCF">				<tr>					<td width="1" bgcolor="#000000"><img src="/web/20121112143244im_/http://www.pbs.org/race/images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="1"></td>					<td><div align="left"><img src="/web/20121112143244im_/http://www.pbs.org/race/images/spacer.gif" width="570" height="1"><br>						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&copy;						2003 California Newsreel.
