What sets true artisticexpression apart from the behavior of an animal, such as a bowerbird thatdecorates its� nest in order to attract a mate, is that artistic expressionrequires higher-order consciousness. Higher-order consciousness means that theartist is not only aware of aesthetic differences, but they are also aware oftheir own awareness and hence the possibility that others share this awarenessor experiential world. One way to get a handle on the evolution of higher-orderconsciousness is through a phylogenetic comparison.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:30.75pt;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'><spanstyle='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The German scientist, JacobVon Uexkull, used the term <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Umwelt</i> todescribe the perceptional world that is experienced by different species. Theperceptual world of a bloodhound for example, would be much more dominated byinformation relating to olfaction than information from other sensorymodalities including vision. Uexkull believed that as organisms evolved moresense organs and greater neurological complexity, their overall awarenessincreased. Thus, the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Umwelt</i> of anearthworm would be of a very rudimentary nature consisting of simple somatosensoryinformation. Just increasing the number of sense organs necessitated anincrease in neurological complexity to some degree. However, once the sensesthat we are familiar with had evolved in vertebrates, there was a great deal ofbrain evolution still to take place. A system of cross-referencing across thedifferent sense modalities was a critical aspect of this neurologicalevolution. For example, the sound of a snapping twig could be localized forvisual scanning and then the olfactory senses could be brought to bear todetermine if indeed an intruder was in the general vicinity. There is evidencethat certain cross-modal associations have become hardwired possibly to improveperceptual efficiency and to lower response times. English children werecompared to children from Kenya in a task that required them to match anonsense word with a pictoral display (Davis, 1961). Children from both groupsmatched the word �malume� with a curved shape and the word �takete� with apointed shape.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:30.75pt;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'><spanstyle='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>As was pointed out in thechapters on brain development and language, the exigencies of functioning in asocial environment greatly accelerated brain evolution and consequently thegeneral level of consciousness or awareness. It was speculated that thedevelopment of a theory of mind, i.e., possessing the idea that others have amind similar to one�s own and using this concept to try to manipulate thebehavior of the others, was a key factor in the evolution of higher primates.Unfortunately, it has been difficult to demonstrate the existence of theory ofmind in non-human primate species to date. If theory of mind exists in otherprimate species, it may be in an incipient form, which is to say it may be acompletely non-conscious process. Since theory of mind is currentlyconceptualized as being a fully conscious process, we may need another term todescribe what various species of monkeys and apes are actually doing when theytry to manipulate the behavior of others.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:30.75pt;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'><spanstyle='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The first requisite inhaving a bonafide theory of mind, i.e., a conscious theory of mind, isself-awareness. By self-awareness we mean that an individual has a mentalconstruct of oneself as a distinct entity, separate from everyone andeverything else. In 1970, Gordon Gallup reported an experiment which he claimedto demonstrate self-awareness in chimpanzees. His experiment was a variation ofthe rouge test, which had been used by developmental psychologists for manyyears to demonstrate the point in human development when very young childrenfirst demonstrate self-awareness. In the developmental test, a mark of rouge,or some other distinctive coloring, is clandestinely placed on the forehead ofthe young child. The child is then placed in front of a mirror. Very youngchildren, around one year in age, will typically look at the mirror image andreact to it as if they were looking at another child. They will attempt to playwith this other child they see in the mirror. Most human children around 18months of age show a different response. They look in the mirror, note there isa mark of coloring upon their foreheads, and then they try to wipe it away.This response is seen as being indicative of a concept of self. Moreconservative critics say it does not really demonstrate self-concept but onlymirror recognition, which may be a different quality. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:30.75pt;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'><spanstyle='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Gallop (1970) used this sameprocedure when a chimpanzee was anesthetized for its� periodical medicalcheckup; an odorless red dye was applied to the chimps forehead while it layunconscious. When the animal regained consciousness a mirror was placed next toits� cage, and the chimpanzee showed all the behaviors indicative of mirrorself-recognition. The animal tried to wipe the dye from its� forehead and italso positioned its� body at various angles in front of the mirror in order tosee places it could not ordinarily see on its� own body. Since Gallop�s earlyexperiment, numerous other chimpanzees have passed the mirror test as well asother species of great apes including the orangutan and some gorillas that hadbeen reared by humans (Gallup &amp; Suarez, 1986; <span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Patterson, &amp; Cohn, 1994; </span>Patterson, 1984; Povinelli, 1993).Because of the inherent adaptive differences in intelligent marine species suchas the bottlenose dolphin, procedures used to demonstrate self-awareness inprimates are highly problematic with cetacean species (<span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Marino, Reiss &amp; Gallup, 1994).</span> Nevertheless, studies usingmirrors and TV monitors in mirror mode make a compelling case for the existenceof self-recognition in the bottlenose dolphin (<span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Marten &amp; Psarakos, 1994).</span> Not all great apes immediately passthe mirror test and often they require prolonged exposure to mirrors beforethey understand what they are looking at. However, regardless of the length oftime that the individuals are exposed to mirrors, no member of any otherspecies, outside of the humans, great apes, and possibly bottlenose dolphinshave ever passed this mirror recognition test (Gallup, 1994). Monkeys can be inthe presence of a mirror for thousand of hours without ever acquiring thislevel of awareness (Gallup, 1977). At first they react to it as an intrudingmember of their own species, but eventually they habituate and ignore themirror all together. Based on these findings, it would seem that the best placeto look for theory of mind in non-human species would be in our close relativesthe chimpanzees.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:30.75pt;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'><spanstyle='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>In 1978, David Premack andGuy Woodruff reported the results of a study on an adult chimpanzee namedSarah. The investigators showed Sarah a series of videotapes with human actors portrayingvarious problems. For example, the videotape might show a human actor jumpingup and down trying to reach a bunch of bananas hanging from the ceiling thatwere just out of reach. Following this videotape, Sarah would be given a set ofphotographs, one of which showed a solution to the problem, in this case,several boxes stacked on top of each other just below the bunch of bananas.Sarah would consistently choose the photograph that represented a viablesolution to the problem shown in the videotape. Interestingly, Sarah�s was muchmore likely to choose a �good�, i.e., correct, outcome if the actor in thevideotape was a trainer that she liked. If the videotape depicted an individualwhom Sarah was suspected of disliking she would typically choose an outcomethat displayed the actor in some mishap such as lying under cement blocks.Based on these findings, the investigators concluded that Sarah recognized thevideotape as representing a problem, understood the actor�s purpose, and chosesolutions compatible with that purpose except in those instances that involveda particular individual that she disliked. This, Premack and Woodrup argued,demonstrated theory of mind in chimpanzees. Unfortunately, additional,corroborating evidence for theory of mind in chimpanzees has not beenforthcoming. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:30.75pt;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'><spanstyle='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>David Povinelli has workedextensively on the problem of demonstrating theory of mind in chimpanzees butgenerally his results have been nil (Povinelli and Preuss, 1995). Although hehas time and time again confirmed Gallop�s original findings of self-awareness,or at least mirror self-recognition in chimpanzees (Povinelli, Gallup, Eddy,&amp; Bierschwale, 1997) the outcomes of the theory of mind studies have notcorroborated Premack�s earlier (1978) findings. Povinelli and Eddy (1996)investigated theory of mind in chimpanzees by having their chimp subjectsobserve two human trainers who were present when food was cashed in a certainsecret location. The chimps could see the trainers but not the location of thefood. In one human trainer, the cloth covered the eyes like a blindfold, whilein the other, the cloth was placed lower on the face acting as a gag. All ofthe chimpanzees tested showed no discrimination between the two trainers andwere just as likely to beg for food from the blindfolded individual, who had noknowledge of the food�s location, as from the sighted individual. On the otherhand, human children as young as two years of age easily discriminated betweenthe two experimenters and preferentially choose the experimenter whose visionwas unimpeded for the reinforcer, in this case, stickers. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:30.75pt;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'><spanstyle='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>By age four, the theory ofmind concept is well developed in human children. For example, a child is givena crayon box only to find the box is full of candles instead of crayons. Whenthe experimenter asks the child what another child would expect to find in thesame box, a child who is over four years of age will answer �crayons,� and ayounger child, will answer �candles.� Based on these findings, it is assumed childrenunder four years of age do not have a fully developed theory of mind concept.Autistic individuals typically fail this sort of false belief test and anabsence of theory of mind has been proposed to explain many of the symptoms ofautism. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:30.75pt;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'><spanstyle='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Autism is characterized byextreme deficits in social behavior and understanding. Children with autismdisplay an emotional indifference to others and treat close family membersexactly the same way they treat complete strangers. Verbal and non-verbalcommunication is extremely impaired. These individuals also display noimagination or creativity. They prefer a sameness of routine and are verydisturbed by any slight changes. Autistic individuals interpret speech veryliterally, for example, if one asks �Can you pass the salt?� a child withautism might reply �Yes� as though they were being queried about their abilityto do this rather than being requested to actually pass the salt to theindividual (Mitchell, 1997). Certain high-functioning autistic individuals showgreat abilities in making mathematical calculations or in memorizing a greatamount of seemingly irrelevant information, such as the contents of phonebooks. There is a very mechanical, machine-like quality in these abilities. Forexample, two young autistic artists, Steven Wiltshire and Nadia, produceextremely realistic and detailed line drawings. These drawing have an extremephotographic quality about them, as if they were produced by a camera ratherthan a thinking, feeling being. Many of these deficits seem to be directlylinked to a lack of theory of mind in autistic individuals. A failure tounderstand other peoples beliefs would restrict a child to excessive literalinterpretations of the speech of others. Their problems of relating socially toothers and understanding the emotions of others could also be directly linkedto their failure to understand theory of mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:30.75pt;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>Althoughsome of the symptoms of autism can be directly causally linked to a poorlydeveloped theory of mind, it is probably more accurate to view the deficits intheory of mind and the other deficits as part of a global impairment. Theseglobal deficits are due to neurological abnormalities, particularly in a regionof the brain known as the cerebellum. As was pointed out in chapter 2, thecerebellum is involved in the precise sequencing of motor movements,particularly ballistic movements. This was the basis of Calvin�s so-called,ballistic hypothesis, namely that the development of the cerebellum due to theselection for more accurate throwing movements provided the requisiteneurological substrates for language evolution. The cerebellar abnormalitiesthat result in autism suggest the cerebellum plays a critical role, not only inballistic motor sequencing, but also in the sequencing of language, socialintelligence, imagination and creativity, theory of mind and intentionally. Itwould seem that there has been a long history of co-evolutionary developmentbetween all of these traits. </p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:30.75pt;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'><spanstyle='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The efforts of a fewautistic artists not withstanding, the key features of the creativity that havecharacterized our species since the late Pleistocene<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>are higher order consciousness, theory of mind, and intentionally.A developed aesthetic sense and symbolic reasoning are, of course, alsonecessary elements in producing art but they are not sufficient in and ofthemselves. As we have seen, an aesthetic sense evolves directly from adaptivepreferences, which are exhibited in other animal species. Our phylogeneticcousins, the great apes, are quite adept at manipulating and understandingsymbols and although there are examples of chimpanzee paintings, such endeavorsare not a part of the normal repertoire of the species. Only in our species isa effort made to creatively manipulate elements of the outer world such thatthey can express something of our inner subjective state as individuals, orcollectively, as groups of individuals. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:30.75pt;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'><spanstyle='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>As we noted earlier, thereis an intimate link between art and play and ritual. These elements of art andplay and ritual come full circle when we ritualize play into athleticcompetitions and these competitions are appreciated as expressions of art in avery real sense. When a football fan delights in watching a receiver stretchout to catch a pass over the middle before being pummeled violently by a pairof linebackers, this is just as much a form of artistic appreciation as thatexperienced by thousands of painting enthusiasts who visit the Louvre each dayin Paris. The essence of art is its ability to captivate. Modern sports do justthat by displaying grace and elegance often juxtaposed with violence. Theinnate preferences that maintain the complex cultural traditions that manifestas sporting events probably arose through the adaptive advantage accrued fromhaving a very active interest in intertribal skirmishes. The central functionof sporting contests, in terms of evolved adaptations, is not to produceaesthetic responses but these responses are certainly a common phenomenon. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:30.75pt;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'><spanstyle='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The same is true ofentertainment. Despite the label of �entertainment arts� the primary functionof entertainment is not to produce art, although this is often an outcomeincidental and sometimes integral to the production of entertainment.Entertainment taps into our innate interest in the social behavior of ourfellow humans. In particular, we are interested in sex, courtship, competition,and danger. Narrative, the telling of stories, is probably as old as languageitself. A keen interest in attending to stories would have been essential forassimilating the cultural database. A powerful adaptive advantage would belongto individuals possessing such an interest in narrative, while, conversely,individuals who lacked such an interest would have been at severe disadvantage.The existence of thousands of myths, legends, folk-tales, novels, plays, andmovies is the result of our having descended from ancestors who had a definitepreference for attending to stories. As to what percentage of �entertainment�represents art is open to debate. If we use Dissanayake's definition of art, assomething made special, then the sheer banality of most works of entertainmentexcludes them from the category, art.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:30.75pt;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Art enrichesvirtually every aspect of human existence. It can exist as something in and ofitself. More often it is embedded in other features of human life.Entertainment, religion, body adornment, architecture, transportation, play,are all enhanced by art. Even science is enhanced by elegant creativity. Art ismade possible by a combination of inner aesthetic values (a feature we sharewith other species) and higher order consciousness (a feature known to existonly in humans) that gives us the capacity to act intentionally. The highlydeveloped human brain is capable of generating complex mental representationsincluding elaborate visual images. Higher order consciousness gives us thecapacity to be aware of our own mental representations and also, to be awarethat consciousness and mental attributes can exist in others. This provides theimpetus to shape matter in such a way that it can convey something of our innerexperience to others. The ways in which matter can be shaped for this purposeare myriad. Painting, sculpture, music, and narrative, are categories forartistic expression with a very ancient history. As our technologicalsophistication increases, more and more categories for artistic expression areadded. But regardless of whether the medium is paint, photographic film, orelectronic digital information the basic motivation for creative expression liesin our evolved psychology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:30.75pt;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p></div></body></html>
