Let us follow the natural orderand begin with the primary facts.</p><p>Epic poetry and Tragedy, as also Comedy, Dithyrambic poetry, and mostflute-playing and lyre-playing, are all, viewed as a whole, modes ofimitation. But at the same time they differ from one another in threeways, either by a difference of kind in their means, or by differencesin the objects, or in the manner of their imitations.</p><p>I. Just as form and colour are used as means by some, who (whether byart or constant practice) imitate and portray many things by theiraid, and the voice is used by others; so also in the above-mentionedgroup of arts, the means with them as a whole are rhythm, language,and harmony&#151;used, however, either singly or in certain combinations.A combination of rhythm and harmony alone is the means influte-playing and lyre-playing, and any other arts there may be of thesame description, e.g. imitative piping. Rhythm alone, withoutharmony, is the means in the dancer&#8217;s imitations; for even he, by therhythms of his attitudes, may represent men&#8217;s characters, as well aswhat they do and suffer. There is further an art which imitates bylanguage alone, without harmony, in prose or in verse, and if inverse, either in some one or in a plurality of metres. This form ofimitation is to this day without a name. We have no common name for amime of Sophron or Xenarchus and a Socratic Conversation; and weshould still be without one even if the imitation in the two instanceswere in trimeters or elegiacs or some other kind of verse&#151;though itis the way with people to tack on &#8217;poet&#8217; to the name of a metre, andtalk of elegiac-poets and epic-poets, thinking that they call thempoets not by reason of the imitative nature of their work, butindiscriminately by reason of the metre they write in. Even if atheory of medicine or physical philosophy be put forth in a metricalform, it is usual to describe the writer in this way; Homer andEmpedocles, however, have really nothing in common apart from theirmetre; so that, if the one is to be called a poet, the other should betermed a physicist rather than a poet. We should be in the sameposition also, if the imitation in these instances were in all themetres, like the <em>Centaur</em> (a rhapsody in a medley of all metres) ofChaeremon; and Chaeremon one has to recognize as a poet. So much,then, as to these arts. There are, lastly, certain other arts, whichcombine all the means enumerated, rhythm, melody, and verse, e.g.Dithyrambic and Nomic poetry, Tragedy and Comedy; with thisdifference, however, that the three kinds of means are in some of themall employed together, and in others brought in separately, one afterthe other. These elements of difference in the above arts I term themeans of their imitation.</p><p class="continue"><a href="the-poetics-3.html"><img src="files/continue.gif" alt="" />Continue...</a></p><div class="chapterNavigationMany"> <a href="/the-poetics-1.html">Preface</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <strong>Aristotle on the Art of Poetry: 1</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-3.html">2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-4.html">3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-5.html">4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-6.html">5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-7.html">6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-8.html">7</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-9.html">8</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-10.html">9</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-11.html">10</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-12.html">11</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-13.html">12</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-14.html">13</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-15.html">14</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-16.html">15</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-17.html">16</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-18.html">17</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-19.html">18</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-20.html">19</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-21.html">20</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-22.html">21</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-23.html">22</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-24.html">23</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-25.html">24</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-26.html">25</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="/the-poetics-27.html">26</a></div><p class="footer">This complete text of the The Poetics book by Aristotle,translated by Ingram Bywater, with a preface by Gilbert Murray,is in the public domain.
