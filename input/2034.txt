These sources are also linked to degradation of air quality and acid     deposition.<br>    <br>  <li>Since the SAR, significant progress has been achieved in better characterising     the direct radiative roles of different types of aerosols. Direct radiative     forcing is estimated to be -0.4 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for sulphate, -0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup>     for biomass burning aerosols, -0.1 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for fossil fuel organic     carbon and <br>    <br>    +0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> for fossil fuel black carbon aerosols. There is much     less confidence in the ability to quantify the total aerosol direct effect,     and its evolution over time, than that for the gases listed above. Aerosols     also vary considerably by region and respond quickly to changes in emissions.<br>    <br>  <li>In addition to their direct radiative forcing, aerosols have an indirect     radiative forcing through their effects on clouds.

Since the late 1970s, satellite     instruments have observed small oscillations due to the 11-year solar cycle.     Mechanisms for the amplification of solar effects on climate have been proposed,     but currently lack a rigorous theoretical or observational basis.<br>    <br>  <li>Stratospheric aerosols from explosive volcanic eruptions lead to negative     forcing, which lasts a few years. Several major eruptions occurred in the     periods 1880 to 1920 and 1960 to 1991.<br>    <br>  <li>The combined change in radiative forcing of the two major natural factors     (solar variation and volcanic aerosols) is estimated to be negative for the     past two, and possibly the past four, decades.<br></ul><h3>Confidence in the ability of models to project future climate has increased.</h3><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="right">  <tr>     <td class="figure"> <a href="figspm-4.htm" target="_top"><img src="/web/20070601014140im_/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/images/figspm-4s.gif" width="300" height="258" border="0"></a><br>      <b>Figure 4: </b>Simulating the Earth�s temperature variations, and       comparing the results to measured changes, can provide insight into the       underlying causes of the major changes. <br>      <br>      A climate model can be used to simulate the temperature changes that occur       both from natural and anthropogenic causes. The simulations represented       by the band in (a) were done with only natural forcings: solar variation       and volcanic activity. Those encompassed by the band in (b) were done with       anthropogenic forcings: greenhouse gases and an estimate of sulphate aerosols,       and those encompassed by the band in (c) were done with both natural and       anthropogenic forcings included. From (b), it can be seen that inclusion       of anthropogenic forcings provides a plausible explanation for a substantial       part of the observed temperature changes over the past century, but the       best match with observations is obtained in (c) when both natural and anthropogenic       factors are included. These results show that the forcings included are       sufficient to explain the observed changes, but do not exclude the possibility       that other forcings may also have contributed. The bands of model results       presented here are for four runs from the same model. Similar results to       those in (b) are obtained with other models with anthropogenic forcing.

Such models cannot yet simulate all aspects of climate (e.g., they still cannot account fully for the observed trend in the surface-troposphere temperature difference since 1979) and there are particular uncertainties associated with clouds and their interaction with radiation and aerosols. Nevertheless, confidence in the ability of these models to provide useful projections of future climate has improved due to their demonstrated performance on a range of space and time-scales. <br><ul>  <li>Understanding of climate processes and their incorporation in climate models     have improved, including water vapour, sea-ice dynamics, and ocean heat transport.<br>    <br>  <li>Some recent models produce satisfactory simulations of current climate without     the need for non-physical adjustments of heat and water fluxes at the ocean-atmosphere     interface used in earlier models.<br>    <br>  <li>Simulations that include estimates of natural and anthropogenic forcing     reproduce the observed large-scale changes in surface temperature over the     20th century (<a href="#figspm4" target="_top">Figure 4</a>). However, contributions from     some additional processes and forcings may not have been included in the models.

That report also noted that the anthropogenic signal was still emerging from the background of natural climate variability. Since the SAR, progress has been made in reducing uncertainty, particularly with respect to distinguishing and quantifying the magnitude of responses to different external influences. Although many of the sources of uncertainty identified in the SAR still remain to some degree, new evidence and improved understanding support an updated conclusion.<br><ul>  <li>There is a longer and more closely scrutinised temperature record and new     model estimates of variability.

Reconstructions     of climate data for the past 1,000 years (<a href="005.htm#figspm1" target="_top">Figure     1b</a>) also indicate that this warming was unusual and is unlikely<a href="Footnote" target="_top" onclick="window.open(&quot;fnspm.htm#7&quot;,&quot;Footnote&quot;,&quot;scrollbars,width=350,height=300&quot;);return false;"><small><sup>7</sup></small></a>     to be entirely natural in origin. <br>    <br>  <li>There are new estimates of the climate response to natural and anthropogenic     forcing, and new detection techniques have been applied.

However, they indicate that natural forcings may have contributed     to the observed warming in the first half of the 20th century. <br>    <br>  <li>The warming over the last 50 years due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases     can be identified despite uncertainties in forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate     aerosol and natural factors (volcanoes and solar irradiance). The anthropogenic     sulphate aerosol forcing, while uncertain, is negative over this period and     therefore cannot explain the warming.
