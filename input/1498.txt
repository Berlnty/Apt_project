The       rubric nevertheless persists because the arts produced by small-scale cultures       share significant elements in common.�The tribal arts which have gained       the greatest attention in the West come from the Americas (such as the Inuit,       Southwest and Plains Indians, and isolated areas of Central and South America),       Oceania (including Melanesia and Australia, Polynesia and New Zealand),       and Subsaharan Africa. The characteristics which define a small-scale, traditional       society are (1) isolation, politically and economically, from civilizations       of Europe, North Africa, or Asia, (2) oral traditions in the absence of       literacy, (3) small, independent population groupings, usually in villages       of no more than a few hundred souls who live a life of face-to-face social       interaction and informal social control, (4) a low level of labor/craft       specialization, (5) subsistence by hunting, fishing, and gathering and/or       small-scale agriculture, (6) little technology beyond hand tools, and that       often of stone rather than metal, and (7) slow rates of cultural change       prior to European contact.�Of this list, small size, lack of written language,       and isolation from large civilizations are the essential features of societies       whose art is discussed here.       <p></p>      <p>As the European interest in �primitive� art grew in the second half of         the nineteenth century, attention was first captured by carvings and masks,         as these were the easiest to transport back to the capitals of colonial         empire.�The arts of small-scale societies include, however, far more than         transportable artifacts: musical and dance performance, oral literatures,         textiles and jewellery, and relatively perishable or ephemeral arts, such         as sandpainting and body painting.�Cultures tend to specialize in some         arts at the apparent expense of others; the Sepik peoples of northern         New Guinea, for example, are renown for their wood carving, while their         countrymen in the interior highlands hardly carve at all, but focus extraordinary         care and attention on stunning body decorations.�The acute aesthetic sensibilities         of peoples of small-scale societies extend beyond crafted arts.�Nilotic         cattle herders of east Africa, such as the Dinka, have a refined sense         for the natural colors and forms of cattle markings, around which they         have built a subtle aesthetic vocabulary for critical discourse. </p>      <p>Whether such activities and artifacts amount to art at all in the European         meaning of the terms is a question persistently raised in anthropological         and aesthetic literature.�Rudolf Arnheim has claimed that tribal art �is         not made to produce pleasurable illusions,� but is �a practical instrument         for the important business of daily living.&#148;&nbsp;More recently, anthropologist         Alfred Gell has argued that the importance of tribal art lies in its utility         as a magical technology, rather than in its aesthetic appeal.� Thus the         colorful appearance of a canoe may dazzle a trading partner, the decorations         on an spear may help it find its target, or a carving�s importance derive         from the fact that it is occasionally inhabited by a god or by the ghost         of an ancestor; it follows that the European�s valuing of such objects         merely because of their beauty would be ethnocentric.�Gell�s emphasis         on the remoteness of tribal arts from familiar, European aesthetic interests         can be bolstered by considering some of the remarkable practices in the         local contexts of tribal arts: for instance, <i>malangan</i> figures of         New Ireland are sometimes unceremoniously burned following the ritual         for which they were a centerpiece.� </p>      <p>Yet it is arguable that too much stress has been placed on the differences         between Western and tribal arts.�For instance, there are folk traditions         in European Christianity in which an icon of the Virgin may temporarily         be inhabited by her spirit, and it develops that New Ireland artists may         have very good reason for wanting to burn a laboriously produced <i>malangan</i>,         if the carving has in the course of a rite acquired potent magical powers         which could be put to malevolent use were it not destroyed. Generally,         it is difficult to find a practice involving tribal art in its original         magical, religious, political, or entertainment context for which there         cannot be discovered a plausible analogue involving acknowledged �art�         products and practices in the civilizations of Asia and Europe. </p>      <p>Moreover, even when Westerners are ignorant of the original context of         use of tribal arts, the immediately perceptible visible organization of         a putative work of tribal art � color, imaginative representation, order         and balance � seems often to mark its aesthetic status.� In this respect,         what Robert Goldwater has termed the �directly visual� impact of tribal         arts is no more mysterious (and no less powerful) than the encounters,         however decontextualized, with fragments of ancient art works of the West.�Furthermore,         even the most culturally remote or naive audience will recognize a human         face or human body in a work of art, and this can provide a point from         where appreciation can begin (this fact may explain, incidentally, why         the most desirable tribal carvings in the Western market for such art         continue to be renderings of the human form). </p>      <p>The characteristics of the art of tribal societies have been catalogued         by H. Gene Blocker.� According to him the tribal art object normally (1)         is of aesthetic (sensual or imaginative) interest, (2) is made by a specialist         producer of art, (3) is subject to critical appraisal, (4) is set apart         from ordinary life, (5) represents the real or a mythological world or         events in either literally or symbolically, (6) is <i>intended</i> to         be understood as a symbolic or as mimetic representation, (7) involves         the possibility of novelty within a tradition, (8) is made by a person         often seen as �eccentric� or socially alienated within the indigenous         context.� While one might might dispute the applicability of any of these         criteria to every small-scale society (e.g. , carving is a special activity         of an �lite few in some Polynesian cultures, whereas in most of Melanesia         virtually any man can try his hand at it), the list is nevertheless a         useful reminder that tribal arts are very far from being crude or primitive         in any aesthetic sense, but are the mature, fully developed arts of technologically         less developed societies.</p>      <p>An imaginative challenge to the claim that the artistic status of tribal         artifacts is necessarily perceptible in visible form has been mounted         by Arthur Danto, who suggests a thought experiment: imagine two tribes,         the Pot People and the Basket Folk, both of whom produce what are to European         eyes indistinguishable pots and baskets.� In the minds of these tribal         peoples, however, there is an enormous difference between Pot People pots         and Basket Folk pots (and conversely with baskets), for the pots are works         of art, embodying deep symbolism for the Pot People, whereas they are         mere utilitarian artifacts for the Basket Folk.� Since this is for Danto         a conceivable situation, it follows that for these imagined tribes, and         possibly generally as well, the status of an artifact as work of art results         from the ideas a culture applies to it, rather than its inherent physical         or perceptible qualities.� Cultural interpretation (an art theory of some         kind) is therefore constitutive of an object�s arthood.</p>      <p>If supportable, Danto�s thought experiment would have important implications         for the Western encounter with tribal arts, for it would follow from it         that knowledge of the cultural context of, say, an Oceanic ancestor figure         was not merely an enriching support to the immediate aesthetic impact         of the object.� Rather, its original culture would exhaustively determine         whether the object was art at all; appreciation of formal aesthetic qualities         in the absence of considerable cultural knowledge therefore risks being         completely delusive.� However, it is difficult to imagine circumstances         where something like Danto�s example could actually exist.� Those works         of tribal art which embody dense cultural meaning are in small-scale societies         normally ones into which are invested the greatest care, craftsmanship,         and critical discernment.� In Danto�s example, even though we can well         imagine Europeans might find it difficult or even impossible to distinguish         between Basket Folk baskets (works of art) and Pot People baskets (utilitarian         craft objects), it is hard to envision the situation where the basket         weavers of the Basket Folk would not be able to tell the difference (I         might mistake a Terborch for a Hals, but it is unlikely Terborch or Hals         ever did so). </p>      <p>Nevertheless, Danto�s approach to the problem of cross-cultural aesthetic         understanding, even if overdrawn, is a useful reminder of the importance         of cultural knowledge in grasping works of tribal art.�As they are deeply         embedded in their cultural contexts, tribal arts are governed by systems         of rules as complex as those that govern Western art forms.�Moreover,         it seems probable that societies which lack writing as a means of recording         information and tradition invest art works with a greater density of meaning         than literate societies.� It may also be the case that an isolated society         that has no access to alternative visual representations outside of its         own art may develop highly sophisticated and aesthetically powerful stylizations. It is perhaps for this reason that many judges from both within and outside         small-scale societies have remarked on the degradation of tribal arts         once they come in close contact with industrial societies.</p>      <p>Whether such a view is fair to indigenous artists or instead represents         ethnocentric prejudice is a topic of fierce debate.�Many knowledgeable         collectors and curators of tribal arts wish mainly to acquire and display         works made in a traditional style for a traditional religious or social         use which are thus designated �authentic.&#148;&nbsp;The market in tribal art therefore         places a premium on African masks that have been used in a dance, Philippine         carvings encrusted with years of oil and blood offerings, or decorated         New Guinean fighting shields peppered with arrowheads from combat.�At         the same time, contemporary tourist or �airport� art made explicitly for         sale to foreigners is passed over as inferior, since it does not reflect         the indigenous values of the society, but only the demands of an alien         market.�This Western valorization of authenticity has been sternly criticized         by Larry Shiner, who argues that it �is not merely an ethnocentric reflection         of the modern discourse of Fine Art; it is also a piece of ideology, an         unintended justification of a continuing exploitative power relation.&#148;&nbsp;Westerners         fantasize that old, authentic works were produced by tribal artists in         the unspoiled, edenic state of such societies prior to colonial contact.�Yet         as Shiner points out, there was a healthy circulation of ideas with much         artistic and cultural borrowing in tribal societies before European contact;         the fact that tribal artists now borrow from the West itself is a continuation         of an authentic tradition of cultural exchange.�Such a value system works         against contemporary indigenous artists, unless they become adept at producing         the countless faked �old� masks and carvings which have flooded the tribal         art market in recent years.� </p>      <p>Yet while it may be unjust that the airport art of developing societies         should be disparaged by those more wealthy cultures that brought the airports         in the first place, it is not unreasonable that historians and collectors         should retain an abiding interest in the art of small-scale societies         as they existed before the onslaught of the consumer economies of colonizing         powers.�The passionate, imaginative visions of tribal arts,�expressing         as they often do modes of life and thought which have been abandoned since         contact with Western culture, have significantly expanded the West�s notion         of how art can mean.�For those in the West willing to open their eyes         and minds, they offer a wondrous gift.��</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp; </p>      <blockquote>        <p>Abusabib, Mohamed A.� <i>African Art: an Aesthetic Inquiry</i>.� Uppsala,           1995.</p>        <p>Arnheim, Rudolf.� <i>Art and Visual Perception</i>.� Berkeley, 1966.</p>        <p>Blocker, H.
