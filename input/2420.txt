For example, approximately 70,000 different chemicalsare currently used and released into the environment in the UnitedStates alone (Newton and Dillingham 1994). An estimated 100,000chemicals are used worldwide (Nash 1993). In the US, nearly 10% ofthe approximately 3 billion kg of toxic chemicals released per yearis known to be carcinogenic (USBC 1994). More than 500,000 kg ofapproximately 600 different pesticide chemicals are applied annuallyin the US, while approximately 2.5 million tons are appliedthroughout the world (Pimentel 1996). Additionally, the World HealthOrganization (1992) reports that roughly three million pesticidepoisonings occur annually and result in 220,000 deaths worldwide.Both economically and in terms of human life, these poisoningsrepresent an enormous cost for society.<br></p><p>Some investigators, however, claim that the health risks fromnatural chemicals in foods are even greater than the risks frompesticide residues (see Pimentel and Greiner 1996). They maintainthat some constituents of commonly consumed vegetables like cabbageand broccoli are more toxic to humans than chemical pesticides infoods, although this has not been conclusively proven (see Pimenteland Greiner 1996).<br></p><p>Not only do such alarming claims muddle the food choices thepublic can safely make, but they also run contrary to the latestadvice given by nutritional authorities. The importance of anutritious food supply to human health has been emphasized in reportswhich recommend a diet high in complete carbohydrates, fruits, andvegetables-- particularly those vegetables high in carotene likecabbage, broccoli, and other brassicas. These are, as previouslymentioned, a few of the same foods which some investigators believeto contain natural chemicals that pose a risk to human health.Therefore, the aim of this discussion is to assess the known publichealth risks of pesticides and naturally occurring toxins infoods.<br></p><h3>Pesticides and Public Health<br></h3><p>Human poisonings and their related illnesses are clearly thehighest price paid for pesticide use. About 67,000 pesticidepoisonings resulting in an estimated twenty-seven accidentalfatalities are reported each year in the US (Litovitz et al. 1990).Due to gaps in the demographic data, however, this figure mayrepresent only 73% of the total number of poisonings (Pimentel andGreiner 1996). Although it is impossible to place a precise monetaryvalue on human life, the cost of human pesticide poisonings has beenestimated. Insurance industry studies have computed monetary rangesbetween $1.6 and $8.5 million for the value of a &quot;statistical life&quot;(Nash 1994). Alternatively, the conservative estimate of $2.2 millionper human life-- the average value that the surviving spouse of aslain New York City policeman receives-- may be used (Nash 1994).Based on this figure and the available data, human pesticidepoisonings and related illnesses in the US are estimated to totalabout $933 million each year (Pimentel 1996).<br></p><p>The situation is even worse in other regions of the world.Approximately 80% of the pesticides produced annually in the worldare used in developed countries (WRI/UNEP/UNDP 1994), but less thanhalf of all pesticide-induced deaths occur in these countries(Pimentel and Greiner 1996). A higher proportion of pesticidepoisonings and deaths occur in developing countries where there areinadequate occupational safety standards, protective clothing, andwashing facilities; insufficient enforcement; poor labeling ofpesticides; illiteracy; and insufficient knowledge of pesticidehazards (Pimentel and Greiner 1996).<br></p><p>Additionally, average pesticide residue levels in food are oftenhigher in developing countries than in developed nations. Forexample, a study in Egypt reported that a majority of assayed milksamples, when tested for fifteen different pesticides, containedresidue levels between 60% and 80% (Dogheim et al. 1990). By way ofcontrast, 50% of the milk samples analyzed in a US milk study hadpesticide residues, all in trace quantities well below EPA and FDAregulatory limits (Trotter and Dickerson 1993).<br>About 35% of the foods purchased by American consumers, however, dohave detectable levels of pesticide residues (FDA 1990). Between 1-3%of these foods have pesticide residue levels that are above the legaltolerance level (FDA 1990). Residue levels may be even higher thanthis because the analytical methods now employed in the US detectonly about one-third of the pesticides in use (Minyard and Roberts1991). The contamination rate is undoubtedly higher for fruits andvegetables because these foods receive the highest dosage ofpesticides. In fact, one USDA study has shown that some pesticideresidue remains in fruits and vegatables even after they have beenwashed, peeled, or cored (Wiles and Campbell 1994). Consequently,there are many justifiable reasons why 97% of the public is concernedabout pesticide residues in its food (Pimentel and Greiner 1996).<br></p><p>Throughout the world, the highest levels of pesticide exposure arefound in farm workers, pesticide applicators, and people who liveadjacent to heavily treated agricultural land. Because farmers andfarm workers directly handle 70-80% of the pesticides they use, theyare at the greatest risk of exposure (McDuffie 1994). Theepidemiological evidence suggests a significantly higher rate ofcancer incidence among farmers and farm workers in the US and Europethan among non-farm workers in some areas (Cantor et al. 1992). Inthese high-risk populations, there is strong evidence forassociations between lymphomas and soft-tissue sarcomas and certainherbicides (Zahm et al. 1990), as well as between lung cancer andexposure to organochlorine insecticides (Pesatori et al. 1994).<br></p><p>Consequently, both the acute and chronic health effects ofpesticides warrant attention and concern. While the acute toxicity ofmost pesticides is well documented (Ecobichon et al. 1990),information on chronic human illnesses such as cancer is not assound. For example, based on animal studies, the International Agencyfor Research on Cancer found &quot;sufficient&quot; evidence of carcinogenicityin eighteen pesticides and &quot;limited&quot; evidence in an additionalsixteen pesticides (WHO/UNEP 1989). Similarly, studies have reportedan increased prevalence of certain cancers in farmers (Cantor et al.1992). However, a recent study in Saskatchewan found no significantdifference in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma mortality between farmers andnonfarmers (Wigle et al. 1990). In addition, D. Schottenfeld of theUniversity of Michigan (Pimentel and Greiner 1996) estimates thatfewer than 1% of the human cancer cases in the US are attributable topesticide exposure. Since there are approximately 1.2 million cancercases annually (USBC 1995), Schottenfeld's assessment suggests thatless than 12,000 cases of cancer per year are due to pesticides.<br></p><p>However, there is evidence to suggest that many other acute andchronic maladies are associated with pesticide use. For example, therecently banned pesticide dibromochloropropane (DBCP), which is usedfor plant pathogen control, was found to cause testicular dysfunctionin animal studies (Shemi et al. 1989) and was linked to infertilityin human workers who had been exposed to the chemical (Potashnik andYanai-Inbar 1987). Also, a large body of evidence obtained fromanimal studies suggests that pesticides can produce immunedysfunction (Thomas and House 1989). In a study of women who hadchronically ingested groundwater contaminated with low levels (meanof 16.6 ppb) of aldicarb, Fiore et al. (1986) reported evidence ofsignificantly reduced immune response, although these women did notexhibit any overt health problems.<br></p><p>There is also growing evidence of sterility in humans and variousother animals, particularly in males, due to various chemicals andpesticides in the environment. Sperm counts in Europe have declinedby about 50% and continue to decrease an additional 2% per year.Young male river otters in the lower Columbia River and malealligators in Florida's Lake Apopka have smaller reproductive organsthan males in unpolluted regions of their respective habitats(Colborn et al. 1996).<br></p><p>Although it is often difficult to determine the impact ofindividual pesticides and other chemicals, the chronic healthproblems associated with organophosphorus pesticides-- which havelargely replaced the banned organocholorines-- are of particularconcern (Ecobichon et al. 1990). The malady Organophosphate InducedDelayed Polyneuropathy (OPIDP) is well-documented and is marked byirreversible neurological defects (Lotti 1992). The deterioration ofmemory, moods, and the capacity for abstract thought have beenobserved in some cases (Savage et al. 1988), while other casesindicate that persistent neurotoxic effects may result even after thetermination of an acute organophosphorus poisoning incident(Ecobichon et al. 1990).<br></p><p>Chronic conditions such as OPIDP constitute an important publichealth issue because of their potential cost to society. For example,the effect of pesticides on children has become a growing concern.Children can be exposed to pesticides on a daily basis in a varietyof ways: through the foods they eat, in the houses where they live,or in the communities where they play (Pimentel and Greiner 1996).With the increased realization of the distinct physiologicaldifferences between adults and children, it has become obvious thatthe present pesticide tolerance and regulatory system, as it relatesto children, is severely lacking. All of the regulations to date havebeen based on adult tolerances. Children have much higher metabolicrates than adults, and their ability to activate, detoxify, andexcrete xenobiotic compounds is different than that of adults. Also,because of their smaller physical size, children are exposed tohigher levels of pesticides per unit of body weight. Evidence of thisis found in a study which reported that 50% of all pesticidepoisonings in England and Wales involved children under the age often (Casey and Vale 1994). The use of pesticides in the home has alsobeen linked to childhood cancer (Leiss and Savitz 1995). In general,the realization that children's sensitivities to toxins are muchdifferent than those of adults has provided the impetus for themovement towards setting specific pesticide regulations with childrenin mind (Wiles and Campbell 1994).<br></p><h3>Natural Toxins in Foods<br></h3><p>All human food is a complex mixture of chemicals includingcarbohydrates, amino acids, fats, oils, and vitamins, some of whichmay be toxic if consumed in large quantities (Strong 1974). Plantscontain some chemicals that are known to be toxic to both animals andhumans. Some of these chemicals evolved in plants to protect themfrom insects, plant pathogens, and other organisms (Pimentel 1988). Asmall number of these chemicals, such as the hydrazines found in afew mushrooms, are highly carcinogenic. In general, however, theadverse effects of toxic chemicals in plants are related tointerference with nutrient availability, metabolic processes,detoxification mechanisms, and allergic reactions in particularanimals and humans. Many natural toxins are found in staple foods ofthe human diet such as grains and legumes. Some of these arediscussed below.<br></p><p>Lectin proteins (phytohemagglutinins) are present in varyingamounts in legumes and cereals, and in very small amounts intomatoes, raw vegetables, fruits, and nuts. Ricin, a lectin which isextremely toxic and can be fatal to humans, was used as aninsecticide at one time. When untreated lectins are eaten, theyagglutinate red blood cells and bind to the epithelial cells of theintestinal tract, impairing nutrient absorption. Fortunately, heatdestroys the toxicity of lectins.<br></p><p>Lathyrogens, found in legumes such as chick peas and vetch, arederivatives of amino acids that act as metabolic antagonists ofglutamic acid, a neurotransmitter in the brain (NAS 1973). When foodscontaining these chemicals are eaten in large amounts by humans orother animals, they cause a crippling paralysis of the lower limbsand may result in death. Lathyrism is primarily a problem in someareas of India.<br></p><p>Protease inhibitors are widely distributed throughout the plantkingdom, particularly in the <i>Leguminosae</i> and, to a lesserextent, in cereal grains and tubers. These substances inhibit thedigestive enzymes trypsin and chymotrypsin (Bender 1987). Forexample, raw soybeans contain a protein that inactivates trypsin andresults in a characteristic enlargement of the pancreas and anincrease in its secretory activity. It is this latter effect,mediated by trypsin inhibition, that depresses growth. Clearly,soybeans and other related legumes should be properly cooked andprocessed before being eaten.<br>Potatoes-- which contain two major glycoalkaloid fractions,alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine-- that have been exposed tosunlight show a significant increase in their alkaloid content (NAS1973). Solanine is a cholinesterase inhibitor and can causeneurologic and gastrointestinal symptoms (Oser 1978), potentiallyincluding the fatal depression of the activity of the central nervoussystem.<br></p><p>Cyanogenic glycosides occur in many food plants like cassava, limabeans, and the seeds of some fruits-- peaches, for example. Becauseof their cyanide content, ingestion of large amounts of cassava and,to a lesser extent, lima beans can be fatal if these foods are eatenraw or are not prepared correctly (Strong 1974). Cassava toxicity ismuch reduced by peeling, washing in running water to remove thecyanogen, and then cooking and/or fermenting to inactivate theenzymes and to volatilize the cyanide. In regions like Africa wherecassava is a staple food, care is taken in its preparation for humanconsumption.<br></p><p>Goitrogens (glucosinolates), which inhibit the uptake of iodine bythe thyroid, are present in many commonly consumed plants. They areestimated to contribute approximately 4% to the worldwide incidenceof goiters in humans (Liener 1986). Cabbage, cauliflower, Brusselssprouts, broccoli, kale, kohlrabi, turnips, radish, mustard,rutabaga, and oil seed meals from rape and turnip all possess somegoitrogenic activity (Coon 1975). Effects of thyroid inhibition arenot counteracted by the consumption of dietary iodine. The nature andextent of toxicity of glucosinolates are still the subject of debate.Although there are few, if any, acute human illnesses caused byglucosinolates, chronic and subchronic effects remain a possibility(Heaney and Fenwick 1987).<br></p><p>Additional foods with the potential for antithyroid activityinclude plants in the genus <i>Allium</i> (onion group); othervegetables such as chard, spinach, lettuce, celery, green pepper,beets, carrots, and radishes; legumes such as soybeans, peas,lentils, beans, and peanuts; nuts such as filberts and walnuts;fruits such as pears, peaches, apricots, strawberries, and raisins;and animal products such as milk, clams, oysters, and liver (Coon1975). However, it has not been proven that a diet of these foodswould be goitrogenic unless they comprised an excessively highproportion of the diet, a substantial amount of them were eaten raw,or they were not well cooked. Although goitrogens in foods arelargely destroyed by thorough cooking, it must be acknowledged thatmany of the foods listed above are eaten uncooked (Coon 1975).<br></p><p>The most potent natural toxins responsible for human health risksare the mycotoxins. These are not strictly plant compounds but toxicmetabolites produced by fungi infesting foodstuffs, especiallycereals and nuts, which have been stored under conditions of elevatedtemperature and high humidity (NAS 1989). Among the ailments causedby these mycotoxins, the most notable historically is ergotism, or&quot;St. Anthony's Fire,&quot; which afflicted people centuries ago. This wascaused by ergot alkaloids produced by <i>Claviceps purpurea</i>growing on cereal grains (NAS 1973). Although some mycotoxins havebeen identified as potent liver carcinogens in experimental animals,their role as human carcinogens has not been established.<br></p><p>In addition to microbes, other potentially dangerous contaminantsin plants used as food can originate from the uptake of suchchemicals as nitrate from soil and drinking water (Coon 1975).Nitrate is not considered a human carcinogen, but nitrosamines whichare formed from nitrates and nitrites (such as those used in curingmeats) are carcinogenic in animals (NAS 1989). Other hazardouschemicals like lead, iodine, mercury, zinc, arsenic, copper, andselenium are found in varying quantities in foods, and if consumed inlarge amounts, can cause human health problems or death.<br></p><p>The extent of the risks to human health associated with ingestingnaturally occurring toxins remains a scientifically contentiousmatter (Watson 1987). Debate on this subject has been clouded by theabsence of a systematic approach to defining and, in particular,quantifying human hazards. Although data have been assembled on thechemical properties and biological sources of most of thesecompounds, their long-term risks to public health have not beenestablished. In fact, the National Research Council has concludedthat the current data on human dietary exposure is insufficient andhas underscored the need for new studies with larger sample sizes andrefined testing methods (NAS 1996). Above all, it is important toemphasize that there is presently no firm evidence to demonstrate alink between long-term ingestion of natural toxins in commonly eatenfoods and any type of chronic human illness (NAS 1989; NAS 1996).<br></p><h3>Conclusion<br></h3><p>Most individuals feel that they have little or no choice otherthan depending on the integrity of scientists and government agenciesto ban dangerous pesticides and regulate the dosages and applicationprocedures of those pesticides that are permitted. The last decadehas witnessed a growing awareness in the public sector about thechemicals it is exposed to in food, air, and water. Although theseare perceived as risks over which the individual has no control, someof the public's concerns are being translated into action in order toeliminate the most toxic pesticides. On an individual level, someconsumers are buying pesticide-free foods, while collectively-- as inthe &quot;Big Green&quot; initiative in California-- they are voicing theiropinions through the ballot box.<br></p><p>As pest control research focuses on the ecology of pests and onthe agroecosystem as a whole, results from different regions of theworld indicate that pesticide use can be reduced substantially.Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and the Canadian provinceof Ontario have all adopted effective programs to reduce pesticideuse by 50-75%. In Indonesia, for example, the investment of $1million per year in ecological research in conjunction with extensionprograms that train farmers to conserve natural enemies is payinglarge dividends. Pesticide use for rice in Indonesia has been reduced65%, while rice yields have increased by 12%. As a consequence, theIndonesian government has been able to eliminate $20 million inpesticide subsidies to farmers (Pimentel 1996).<br></p><p>In the US, it is estimated that pesticide use can be reduced by asmuch as 50% at an estimated savings of at least $500 million per yearwithout reducing crop yields or substantially reducing the &quot;cosmeticstandards&quot; of fresh fruits and vegetables. By implementing IPMprograms in the state of New York, for example, sweet corn processorssaved $500,000 per year and maintained high yields while reducingpesticide treatments 55-65%. Pesticide use has been reduced on othercrops in New York as well (Pimentel 1996).<br></p><p>Nevertheless, pesticides will continue to be used on certaincrops, and individuals must determine the degree of risk they arewilling to accept. With food selection, most individuals have theoption of making personal choices. However, the acknowledged healthbenefits of the foods recommended by nutritional authorities are suchthat consumers should not be frightened into eliminating them fromtheir diets because of the implied danger from naturally occurringtoxins. Risk from naturally occurring toxins in foods-- as well asfrom pesticide residues-- depends on the dosage of the chemical, thetime of exposure, and the susceptibility of the individual human.These data, along with the sound experimental investigation ofparticular pesticides or natural toxins, are essential in estimatingthe potential risks to humans of various toxic chemical exposure inhuman foods.<br></p><p>Plants do contain many chemicals-- hydrazines and mycotoxins, forexample-- that are highly toxic to animals and humans. While thesecompounds may play important roles in influencing the incidence ofcertain types of human cancer, the exact proportion of cancers thatare due to &quot;natural&quot; versus synthetic carcinogens is not known(Perera et al. 1991). However, there is evidence to suggest thatsynthetic chemicals present in food may increase cancer risk overthat which may be posed by the presence of natural toxins alone. Forexample, laboratory rodent diets also contain many of the samenaturally-occurring toxins present in the human diet. Nevertheless,compounds such as aflatoxin, TCDD, and DBCP, when added to the dietof mice and rats, significantly increase tumor incidence, even whenpresent at very low levels. This suggests that, in several cases, therisk of tumorigenesis from certain synthetic food contaminants isincreased in the animal over any risk presented by the backgroundlevel of &quot;natural pesticides&quot; (Weinstein 1991). Lacking contraryevidence, there is no reason to assume a difference in humans.<br>However, important caveats should be noted in drawing conclusionsfrom risk analyses of dietary exposure to toxins. Short-term screenssuch as the &quot;Ames test&quot;, whether for genetic damage or increased cellproliferation, are far from 100% accurate in predictingcarcinogenicity and are not a replacement for long-term bioassays(Cohen and Ellwein 1991). Also, no matter how suggestiveepidemiological or experimental studies may be, they cannot provideunequivocal proof that a certain diet will increase the risk ofcancer. No study has directly demonstrated that implementing dietarychanges in a given individual inhibited the onset of cancer or keptan established cancer from spreading.<br>Furthermore, unlike animal experimentation, humans cannot be keptphysically isolated for long periods of time and fed diets containingpossibly toxic substances. Nor can heredity or environmental factorsbe controlled. Data from laboratory animal tests and epidemiologicalstudies with humans must serve as guides for assessing the safety ofthe food supply. Ultimately, it is extremely difficult in the absenceof further information to predict the sensitivity of humans to thetumor-promoting, mitogenic, or cytotoxic potential of a givencompound. Thus, risk extrapolation under conditions in whichindividuals are exposed to multiple factors and in heterogeneouspopulations (the situation in the real world) is much morecomplicated than envisioned by some authors, e.g. Ames and Gold1990.<br></p><p>The causes of chronic illnesses, including cancers, are extremelycomplex. In their lifetime, individuals who differ in genetic make-upand susceptibility are exposed to a wide variety of carcinogens. Somechemicals by themselves are safe but may act as synergists orpromoters in concert with other chemicals to cause illness. Futureresearch as to how human health is affected by increasing exposure toall chemicals is of prime importance. The public is skeptical of whatit reads and hears, and it is becoming more wary of being exposed topesticides and other chemicals.<br><br></p><h3>References<br></h3><p>Ames, B.N. and L.S. Gold. 1990.
