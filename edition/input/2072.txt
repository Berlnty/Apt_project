techniques have transformed the study of human         genetics. </td>    </tr>  </table>  <p> <b> Genetics </b> is the scientific study of inherited variation.     <b> Human genetics</b>, then, is the scientific study of inherited human variation.   </p>  <p> Why study human genetics? One reason is simply an interest in better understanding     ourselves. As a branch of genetics, human genetics concerns itself with what     most of us consider to be the most interesting species on earth: <i> Homo     sapiens</i>. But our interest in human genetics does not stop at the boundaries     of the species, for what we learn about human genetic variation and its sources     and transmission inevitably contributes to our understanding of genetics in     general, just as the study of variation in other species informs our understanding     of our own. </p>  <p> A second reason for studying human genetics is its practical value for human     welfare. In this sense, human genetics is more an applied science than a fundamental     science. One benefit of studying human genetic variation is the discovery     and description of the genetic contribution to many human diseases. This is     an increasingly powerful motivation in light of our growing understanding     of the contribution that genes make to the development of diseases such as     cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. In fact, society has been willing in     the past and continues to be willing to pay significant amounts of money for     research in this area, primarily because of its perception that such study     has enormous potential to improve human health. This perception, and its realization     in the discoveries of the past 20 years, have led to a marked increase in     the number of people and organizations involved in human genetics. </p>  <p> This second reason for studying human genetics is related to the first.     The desire to develop medical practices that can alleviate the suffering associated     with human disease has provided strong support to basic research. Many basic     biological phenomena have been discovered and described during the course     of investigations into particular disease conditions. A classic example is     the knowledge about human sex chromosomes that was gained through the study     of patients with sex-chromosome abnormalities. A more current example is our     rapidly increasing understanding of the mechanisms that regulate cell growth     and reproduction, understanding that we have gained primarily through a study     of genes that, when mutated, increase the risk of cancer. </p>  <p> Likewise, the results of basic research inform and stimulate research into     human disease. For example, the development of recombinant-DNA techniques     (Figure 3) rapidly transformed the study of human genetics, ultimately allowing     scientists to study the detailed structure and functions of individual human     genes, as well as to manipulate these genes in a variety of previously unimaginable     ways. </p>  <p><a name="content"><img src="/web/20130825143543im_/http://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/nih1/genetic/images/dot.gif" alt="start of page content" width="1" height="1"></a>A     third reason for studying human genetics is that it gives us a powerful tool     for understanding and describing human evolution. At one time, data from physical     anthropology (including information about skin color, body build, and facial     traits) were the only source of information available to scholars interested     in tracing human evolutionary history. Today, however, researchers have a     wealth of genetic data, including molecular data, to call upon in their work.   </p>  <h2> <b> How Do Scientists Study Human Genetic Variation? </b> </h2>  <p> Two research approaches were historically important in helping investigators     understand the biological basis of heredity. The first of these approaches,     transmission genetics, involved crossing organisms and studying the offsprings'     traits to develop hypotheses about the mechanisms of inheritance. This work     demonstrated that in some organisms at least, heredity seems to follow a few     definite and rather simple rules. </p>  <p> The second approach involved using cytologic techniques to study the machinery     and processes of cellular reproduction. This approach laid a solid foundation     for the more conceptual understanding of inheritance that developed as a result     of transmission genetics. By the early 1900s, cytologists had demonstrated     that heredity is the consequence of the genetic continuity of cells by cell     division, had identified the gametes as the vehicles that transmit genetic     information from one generation to another, and had collected strong evidence     for the central role of the nucleus and the chromosomes in heredity. </p>  <p> As important as they were, the techniques of transmission genetics and cytology     were not enough to help scientists understand human genetic variation at the     level of detail that is now possible. The central advantage that today's molecular     techniques offer is that they allow researchers to study DNA directly. Before     the development of these techniques, scientists studying human genetic variation     were forced to make inferences about molecular differences from the phenotypes     produced by mutant genes. Furthermore, because the genes associated with most     single-gene disorders are relatively rare, they could be studied in only a     small number of families. Many of the traits associated with these genes are     also recessive and so could not be detected in people with heterozygous genotypes.     Unlike researchers working with other species, human geneticists are restricted     by ethical considerations from performing experimental, "at-will" crosses     on human subjects. In addition, human generations are on the order of 20 to     40 years, much too slow to be useful in classic breeding experiments. All     of these limitations made identifying and studying genes in humans both tedious     and slow. </p>  <p> In the last 50 years, however, beginning with the discovery of the structure     of DNA and accelerating significantly with the development of recombinant     DNA techniques in the mid-1970s, a growing battery of molecular techniques     has made direct study of human DNA a reality. Key among these techniques are     restriction analysis and molecular recombination, which allow researchers     to cut and rejoin DNA molecules in highly specific and predictable ways; amplification     techniques, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which make it possible     to make unlimited copies of any fragment of DNA; hybridization techniques,     such as fluorescence in situ hybridization, which allow scientists to compare     DNA samples from different sources and to locate specific base sequences within     samples; and the automated sequencing techniques that today are allowing workers     to sequence the human genome at an unprecedented rate. </p>  <p> On the immediate horizon are even more powerful techniques, techniques that     scientists expect will have a formidable impact on the future of both research     and clinical genetics. One such technique, <b> DNA chip technology </b> (also     called DNA microarray technology), is a revolutionary new tool designed to     identify mutations in genes or survey expression of tens of thousands of genes     in one experiment. </p>  <p>In one application of this technology, the chip is designed to detect mutations     in a particular gene. The DNA microchip consists of a small glass plate encased     in plastic. It is manufactured using a process similar to the process used     to make computer microchips. On its surface, it contains synthetic single-stranded     DNA sequences identical to those of the normal gene and all possible mutations     of that gene. To determine whether an individual possesses a mutation in the     gene, a scientist first obtains a sample of DNA from the person's blood, as     well as a sample of DNA that does not contain a mutation in that gene. After     denaturing, or separating, the DNA samples into single strands and cutting     them into smaller, more manageable fragments, the scientist labels the fragments     with fluorescent dyes: the person's DNA with red dye and the normal DNA with     green dye. Both sets of labeled DNA are allowed to hybridize, or bind, to     the synthetic DNA on the chip. If the person does not have a mutation in the     gene, both DNA samples will hybridize equivalently to the chip and the chip     will appear uniformly yellow. However, if the person does possess a mutation,     the mutant sequence on the chip will hybridize to the patient's sample, but     not to the normal DNA, causing it (the chip) to appear red in that area. The     scientist can then examine this area more closely to confirm that a mutation     is present. </p>  <p> DNA microarray technology is also allowing scientists to investigate the     activity in different cell types of thousands of genes at the same time, an     advance that will help researchers determine the complex functional relationships     that exist between individual genes. This type of analysis involves placing     small snippets of DNA from hundreds or thousands of genes on a single microscope     slide, then allowing fluorescently labeled mRNA molecules from a particular     cell type to hybridize to them. By measuring the fluorescence of each spot     on the slide, scientists can determine how active various genes are in that     cell type. Strong fluorescence indicates that many mRNA molecules hybridized     to the gene and, therefore, that the gene is very active in that cell type.     Conversely, no fluorescence indicates that none of the cell's mRNA molecules     hybridized to the gene and that the gene is inactive in that cell type. </p>  <p> Although these technologies are still relatively new and are being used     primarily for research, scientists expect that one day they will have significant     clinical applications. For example, DNA chip technology has the potential     to significantly reduce the time and expense involved in genetic testing.     This technology or others like it may one day help make it possible to define     an individual's risk of developing many types of hereditary cancer as well     as other common disorders, such as heart disease and diabetes. Likewise, scientists     may one day be able to classify human cancers based on the patterns of gene     activity in the tumor cells and then be able to design treatment strategies     that are targeted directly to each specific type of cancer. </p>  <h2> <b> How Much Genetic Variation Exists Among Humans? </b> </h2>  <p> <i> Homo sapiens </i> is a relatively young species and has not had as much     time to accumulate genetic variation as have the vast majority of species     on earth, most of which predate humans by enormous expanses of time. Nonetheless,     there is considerable genetic variation in our species. The human genome comprises     about 3 x 10<sup>9 </sup> base pairs of DNA, and the extent of human genetic     variation is such that no two humans, save identical twins, ever have been     or will be genetically identical. Between any two humans, the amount of genetic     variation&#8212;biochemical individuality&#8212;is about 0.1 percent. This     means that about one base pair out of every 1,000 will be different between     any two individuals. Any two (diploid) people have about 6 x 10<sup>6 </sup>     base pairs that are different, an important reason for the development of     automated procedures to analyze genetic variation. </p>  <p> The most common <b> polymorphisms </b> (or genetic differences) in the human     genome are single base-pair differences. Scientists call these differences     SNPs, for single-nucleotide polymorphisms. When two different haploid genomes     are compared, SNPs occur, on average, about every 1,000 bases. Other types     of polymorphisms&#8212;for example, differences in copy number, insertions,     deletions, duplications, and rearrangements&#8212;also occur, but much less     frequently. </p>  <table border="0" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="4" width="238" align="right" hspace="10">    <tr>       <td class="figText"> <a name="fig4"></a><img src="/web/20130825143543im_/http://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/nih1/genetic/images/activities/act1/sa_act1-chart02.gif" width="237" height="239" alt="Figure 4 - genetic variation between 3 different population segments" longdesc="fig4-longdesc.htm"><br>        Figure 4 - Most variation occurs within populations. <a href="fig4-longdesc.htm" title="long description" class="Dlink"><font color="#FFFFFF">D</font></a>       </td>    </tr>  </table>  <p>Notwithstanding the genetic differences between individuals, all humans have     a great deal of their genetic information in common. These similarities help     define us as a species. Furthermore, genetic variation around the world is     distributed in a rather continuous manner; there are no sharp, discontinuous     boundaries between human population groups. In fact, research results consistently     demonstrate that about 85 percent of all human genetic variation exists <i>     within </i> human populations, whereas about only 15 percent of variation     exists <i> between </i> populations (Figure 4). That is, research reveals     that <i> Homo sapiens </i> is one continuously variable, inter-breeding species.     Ongoing investigation of human genetic variation has even led biologists and     physical anthropologists to rethink traditional notions of human racial groups.     The amount of genetic variation between these traditional classifications     actually falls below the level that taxonomists use to designate subspecies,     the taxonomic category for other species that corresponds to the designation     of race in <i> Homo sapiens</i>. This finding has caused some biologists to     call the validity of race as a biological construct into serious question.   </p>  <p> Analysis of human genetic variation also confirms that humans share much     of their genetic information with the rest of the natural world&#8212;an indication     of the relatedness of all life by descent with modification from common ancestors.     The highly conserved nature of many genetic regions across considerable evolutionary     distance is especially obvious in genes related to development. For example,     mutations in the <i> patched </i> gene produce developmental abnormalities     in <i> Drosophila</i>, and mutations in the <i> patched </i> homolog in humans     produce analogous structural deformities in the developing human embryo. </p>  <p> Geneticists have used the reality of evolutionary conservation to detect     genetic variations associated with some cancers. For example, mutations in     the genes responsible for repair of DNA mismatches that arise during DNA replication     are associated with one form of colon cancer. These mismatched repair genes     are conserved in evolutionary history all the way back to the bacterium <i>     Escherichia coli</i>, where the genes are designated <i> Mut l </i>and <i>     Mut  s</i>. Geneticists suspected that this form of colon cancer was     associated with a failure of mismatch repair, and they used the known sequences     from the <i> E. coli </i> genes to probe the human genome for homologous sequences.     This work led ultimately to the identification of a gene that is associated     with increased risk for colon cancer. </p>  <h2> <b> What Is the Significance of Human Genetic Variation? </b> </h2>  <p> Almost all human genetic variation is relatively insignificant biologically&#8212;     that is, it has no apparent adaptive significance. Some variation (for example,     a neutral mutation) alters the amino acid sequence of the resulting protein     but produces no detectable change in its function. Other variation (for example,     a silent mutation) does not even change the amino acid sequence. Furthermore,     only a small percentage of the DNA sequences in the human genome is coding     sequences (sequences that are ultimately translated into protein) or regulatory     sequences (sequences that can influence the level, timing, and tissue specificity     of gene expression). Differences that occur elsewhere in the DNA&#8212;in     the vast majority of the DNA that has no known function&#8212;have no impact.   </p>  <p> Some genetic variation, however, can be positive, providing an advantage     in changing environments. </p>  <!-- end of page content -->  <!-- start of bottom navigation table  -->  <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="bottom page navigation" title="bottom page navigation" width="92%">    <tr>       <td align="right">         <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">          <tr valign="bottom">             <td>&nbsp;</td>            <td> &nbsp;&nbsp; <b> 1 </b> | <a href="genetic_variation2.htm">2</a>               | <a href="genetic_variation3.htm">3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>            <td><a href="genetic_variation2.htm"><img src="/web/20130825143543im_/http://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/nih1/genetic/images/nav/next.gif" width="29" height="11" border="0" alt="next"></a></td>          </tr>        </table>      </td>    </tr>  </table>  <!-- end of bottom navigation table  --></div><!-- #EndEditable --><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/footer.lbi" --><p class="pageIndentSm"><a href="/web/20130825143543/http://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/nih1/genetic/other/copyright.htm">Copyright</a> | <a href="/web/20130825143543/http://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/nih1/genetic/other/credits.htm">Credits</a> | <a href="/web/20130825143543/http://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/nih1/genetic/other/accessibility.htm">Accessibility</a></p><!-- #EndLibraryItem --></body><!-- #EndTemplate --></html><!--     FILE ARCHIVED ON 14:35:43 Aug 25, 2013 AND RETRIEVED FROM THE     INTERNET ARCHIVE ON 16:34:20 Apr 28, 2018.
