Everyone working with computersfor the last two decades has been talking about it, butnothing has been done. Every historical introduction toa computer text contains a section on Babbage, oftenextensive; but they are all based on the quite scantyinformation about the Analytical Engine published duringthe nineteenth century. The immense amount of manuscriptmaterial concerning Babbage extant in England has remainedessentially untouched.<p>The one hoped for exception was Maboth Moseley's<i>Irascible Genius</i> (London, 1964). a full length biographyof Babbage. Moseley consulted the Babbage correspondenceat the British Museum and the unpublished biography ofBabbage written by his friend Harry Wilmot Buxton; yetdespite the fact that Moseley was the editor of a computerjournal, she did not examine Babbage's notebooks anddrawings, now in the Science Museum in South Kensington,and her book contains virtually nothing of interest on theAnalytical Engine. On the whole, <i>Irascible Genius</i> is agood deal less interesting than Babbage's own volume ofmemoirs, <i>Passages from the Life of a Philosopher</i> (London,1864), and it is no more balanced, and not very muchmore accurate.<p>Unfortunately, the publication of Buxton's biography<a name="pageiv"></a>would not solve the problem, for it is basically anunorganized collection of extensive extracts from someof Babbage's books, papers, and letters; and while manyof these are quite interesting, they are badly in need ofmore coherent treatment, and there are many gaps in theircoverage.<p>Consequently, the student of Babbage's work mustreturn directly to the original sources. The manuscriptmaterial is in three primary collections, on which thisstudy is based. Twenty volumes of Babbage's correspondenceare deposited in the British Museum; a similar quantityof technical material is held by the Science Museum inSouth Kensington; and the Museum of the History of Scienceat Oxford University has Buxton's manuscript biography,and, more important, the Babbage papers upon which itwas based.<p>Although Babbage's life and accomplishments encompassed far more that was important than the inventionof his two calculating machines, the Difference andAnalytical Engines, it is on them that new research hasmost been needed; consequently, the present study islimited to material relevant to them. Babbage's earlymathematical work, his role in founding or reformingseveral important scientific societies, and his many otheractivities will scarcely be touched upon. But the firstchapter, by way of introduction, will provide a brief<a name="pagev"></a>sketch of Babbage's life, as it is the context into whichthe calculating machines must be fitted. Likewise, thisstudy will not deal with the development of calculatingmachines before or after Babbage. His work was completelyout of the mainstream of invention and construction whichled from the primitive desk calculators of the seventeenthcentury to their widespread commercial success by thebeginning of the twentieth century, and later to what weknow as computers; Babbage was neither influenced bywhat had gone before nor influential upon what followedhim.<p>The invention, development, attempted construction,and eventual abandonment of the first Difference Enginewill be considered in the second chapter. The third chapterdeals with the invention of the Analytical Engine and itsperiod of primary development, from 1834 to 1847. Thefourth chapter deals with three later concerns of Babbage:a project to interest the government in what he called hisDifference Engine No. 2; support for the Scheutz DifferenceEngine, a simplified version of his own earlier machine;and his resumption of work on the Analytical Engine latein life, with the intention of attempting its construction.The final chapter will provide some observations on thegeneral character of Babbage's work on the AnalyticalEngine.<a name="pagevi"></a>My own interest in Babbage was first aroused througha research project on the history of calculating machinesand computers directed by Professor I.B. Cohen and ProfessorOwen Gingerich on behalf of the International BusinessMachines company for the purpose of developing an IBMmuseum on computers and their history; this project stillcontinues. IBM has also provided generous financial andlogistical support for my own work. A trip to England tostudy the manuscripts was supported by a grant from theNational Science Foundation. Assistance and access tothe sources has been provided by the staffs of the Manuscripts Division of the British Museum, the Museum of theHistory of Science at Oxford University, and especiallythe Science Museum in South Kensington, London, where Dr.H.B. Calvert has long had a special interest in Babbage.Professor Gingerich has read this thesis and madevaluable suggestions, as has Kenneth Manning.<p>To all these and other individuals and institutionswho have helped me in ways large and small, I expressmy gratitude.<p><hr width="80%"><a name="pagevii"></a><h3 align=center>Note on Sources and Quotations</h3><p>The following abbreviations are used in the notes forsources frequently cited.
