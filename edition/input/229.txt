Of all itscontributions however, few can match the importance of the Ordnance Corps' pioneer efforts in the field of electronic computers.  In the interest of national defense, the development of electronic computing systems could not wait until normaleconomic laws brought about the supply of systems through commercial demand.Therefore, recognizing the urgent need for such computers, the Ordnance Corps initiated the development work and supplied the funds that led to the first high-speed, electronic, automatic computer. This computer, called the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer), was proposed in 1942 and completed in 1946.<P><DD>	The installation of the ENIAC in 1947 in the Ballistic Research Laboratoriesat Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, marked the beginning of the widespread use ofelectronic computing machines. Since the advent of the ENIAC, a large expansion hastaken place in the computer field. Investment rates in computing equipment in theUnited States rose from ten million dollars per year in 1953 to one hundred milliondollars per year in 1956. Present (1961) expenditures for computing equipment haspassed the billion dollars per year mark.<P><DD>	Electronic computers find wide use throughout the Department of Defense andmany other government agencies. Almost every commodity industry such as oil,steel, and rubber is utilizing computing equipment<A NAME="p002"> <PRE><TABLE align=right><TD>  <FONT size=-1 Color=blue> Ord. Mono. 1961, INTRODUCTION , starting page 002 <BR>Click here for <a href="U-S-Ord-61-002.tif">TIF version</A> of this page</FONT></TABLE>&nbsp;&nbsp;</PRE>for both scientific and commercial applications. Service industries,such as banking, transportation, and insurance have applied large scalecomputing systems toward the solution of problems in the fields of accounting, reservations control, and bookkeeping. Manufacturers haveused computing systems for design engineering and scientific research.Many systems are being utilized for inventory and stock control. The determination of manufacturing plant location and stock parts storage arebeing made by linear programming methods. Electronic computers are usedby the construction industry for design and location of structures androad nets. Many digital computers form a part of closed loop industrialprocess control systems. Where the processing of large quantities ofdata are necessary, computing systems are invaluable.<P><DD>	It must be left for the historian of the future to accurately evaluatethe effect of automatic computing machines on man's destiny. It is yettoo early to make even a good guess. However, one thing is certain:electronic computers have ushered in a change equal to that of the Industrial Revolution. By the harnessing of mechanical power (steam engine,etc.) man was able to perform work beyond the capacity of his own muscles(or that of beasts of burden) and his world changed as a result. Hecould travel at speeds undreamed of in earlier times, he could fabricatestructures never before possible, and he could build machinery to performintricate work and produce large quantities of consumer goods at low cost.By the development of machinery for handling information and thus enabling<A NAME="p003"><PRE><TABLE align=right><TD> <FONT SIZE=-1 Color=blue> Ord. Mono. 1961, INTRODUCTION , starting page 003 <BR>Click here for <a href="U-S-Ord-61-003.tif">TIF version</A> of this page</FONT></TABLE>&nbsp;&nbsp;</PRE>decisions to be made automatically by mechanizing the logic of mental process, manis now able to perform mental work beyond the capacity of his brain. Many problemsthat have remained unsolved for years because the calculations were too formidablefor a human to perform can now be handled by electronic computers. Aircraft design,ballistic crystallography, electron optics, astronomy, pure mathematics, andweather forecasting are just a few of the activities in which automatic computingmachines are and will continue to play ever increasingly important roles.<P><DD>	At this point it might be well to consider the question; "What is an automaticcomputer?" An automatic computer is a machine so constructed that it can perform acomplicated sequence of arithmetical and logical operations at high speeds, withouthuman intervention or assistance. The present-day automatic computers utilizeelectronic circuits as the major operating components and are capable of computingspeeds of the order of a few millimicroseconds per logical decision. We can properlyrefer to this class of machines as high-speed electronic automatic computers.<P><DD>	It is the term "automatic", however, that designates the most importantcharacteristic of the modern electronic computer. This is its ability to guide andcontrol itself during the course of its data processing action. The human operatoris needed only to set up and start the machine, which can then operate without humanintervention, guidance, or direction. However, the machine is self-directing onlywithin definite prescribed limits which must be predetermined by the operator duringthe setup of the machine and during programming.<A NAME="p004"><PRE><TABLE align=right><TD> <FONT SIZE=-1 Color=blue> Ord. Mono. 1961, INTRODUCTION , starting page 004 <BR>Click here for <a href="U-S-Ord-61-004.tif">TIF version</A> of this page</FONT></TABLE>&nbsp;&nbsp;</PRE>	Automatic computers perform many operations which previously weredone only by human labor and this has led some writers to refer to automatic computers as "giant brains". They definitely are not electronicbrains and do not "think" in the creative sense of the word. A human mindmust first determine a way of solving the problem and then instruct thecomputer how to solve the problem when given the data. The human operationof preparing the instructions for the automatic computer is called programming, and the resulting set of instructions is called a program or aroutine. Without a program, an automatic computer cannot perform anydata processing.<P><DD>	All computers, whether mechanical or electronic, can be divided intotwo distinct classes, depending on the form in which information is handled.If the information is handled in the form of letters or digits they areclassed as digital computers. If the information is handled in the formof an electrical equivalent of physical variables, they are classed asanalog computers. Analog computers may also represent numerical quantities by such physical variables as translation, rotation, voltage, or resistance. The slide rule and the antiaircraft predictor are examples ofanalog computers. The digital computer utilizes numbers in a given scaleof notation to represent all the quantities that occur in a problem or acalculation. The abacus and the desk calculator are examples of digitalcomputers.	In a very general way it can be said that the advantages of the <A NAME="p005"><PRE><TABLE align=right><TD> <FONT SIZE=-1 Color=blue> Ord.

Throughout theOrdnance Corps the digital computer is the one most widely used for the variousOrdnance applications. The analog computer finds use primarily in the olderantiaircraft and antimissile fire control devices.<P><DD>	The importance of automatic computers to the U. S. Army Ordnance Corps is wellillustrated by the extensive use of various types of computers at Ordnance Corpsinstallations. An inventory of computers within the Ordnance Corps for the FiscalYear 1961 lists a total of 112 computers of 36 different types in use at 26 OrdnanceCorps installations.<SUP><A HREF="#App-V">1</A></SUP><P><DD>	At Aberdeen Proving Ground, for example, the Computing Laboratory has apersonnel strength representing 12% of the total personnel of the Ballistic, ResearchLaboratories. The Computing Laboratory employs 122 persons. These include: 51Mathematicians; 15 Electronics Engineers; 4 Tabulating Equipment Operators; 38Maintenance and Supporting personnel; and 14 military. <A NAME="p006"><PRE><TABLE align=right><TD> <FONT SIZE=-1 Color=blue> Ord.

It was one ofthe most significant developments of our time because it enabled us to expand ourknowledge in almost every field through limitless quantities of accurate,inexpensive computation performed at high speeds.<P><DD>	Prior to the advent of the ENIAC, however, were thousands of years ofdevelopment to produce devices which could remove the drudgery of computation. Thevery first requirement was the invention of a means to record numbers. Various meanswere used in early times to do this. The Hebrews, Greeks and Romans, for example,used the letters of their alphabets to represent numbers, but these systems did notlend themselves to easy computation of mathematical problems. Anyone familiar, withthe Roman numeral system can imagine the difficulty in multiplying CCXVII by XXIX to get MMMMMMCCXC111.<P><DD>	In spite of clumsy systems of recording numbers Egyptians, Greeks and Romanswere nonetheless able to perform computations. A method of finger computation evolvedand at some time prior to 600 B. C. an ingenious calculating device, the abacus, wasdeveloped and used by them. This calculating device employed a place system and wasbuilt around the base ten. Strangely enough it seems never to have occurred to thosepeople<A NAME="p007"><PRE><TABLE align=right><TD> <FONT SIZE=-1 Color=blue> Ord. Mono. 1961, CHAPTER I, starting page 007 <BR>Click here for <a href="U-S-Ord-61-007.tif">TIF version</A> of this page</FONT></TABLE>&nbsp;&nbsp;</PRE>to write numerals in this same system. That idea was to come many years later from India.<P><DD>	The Roman-type abacus found its way to the Orient around the twelfth centuryA.D. and today it still remains the principal means of computing in China and Japan.It is a simple device and a skilled operator can add, subtract, multiply and dividewith amazing speed. In fact, the champion abacus operator of Japan some years agodefeated a man using an electric calculating machine. The achievement of such speedand accuracy on the abacus, however, requires considerable training, which is onedisadvantage of the abacus.<P><DD>	The modern abacus consists of a rectangular frame with a number of rods orwires. These rods are divided into two unequal portions by a transverse bar. On theupper, smaller portion of each rod are two beads and on the lower portion five beads.(The modern Japanese abacus has one bead above and four beads below the bar.) Thewhole acts as a numerical register, each rod representing a decimal order as in ourfamiliar "Arabic" notation.<P><DD>	The chief disadvantage of the abacus is that the operator must perform hiscalculations mentally. The device merely stores his results step by step. It does notperform the actual calculations as does the modern desk calculator.<P><DD>	As mentioned previously, in spite of the use of the abacus by the Greeks andRomans the Western peoples did not develop a convenient system of numeration. This wasaccomplished by Hindu scholars nearly two thousand<A NAME="p008"><PRE><TABLE align=right><TD> <FONT SIZE=-1 Color=blue> Ord.

They developed the symbols and the place system which enables us toexpress any number, no matter how large or small it may be. This system is easy tolearn and simple to use. It is built around the base ten, although any numbermight have been used. It is possible that the base of ten was selected because manhad always used his fingers for counting.<P><DD>	The Hindu numerals with their place system were carried westward by merchantsand scholars and finally reached Spain in the tenth century. However it was not untilthe fifteenth century that they finally prevailed, in the Western World and took theirpresent form 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. This development opened the door to modernmathematics.<P><DD>	Around 1600 John Napier, a Scottish mathematician, invented logarithms and alsoprepared a convenient multiplication table on pieces of wood or bone. "Napier's bone",as they were called, had no practical value but his logarithms did. Around 1632William Oughtred in England made the first slide rule by inscribing logarithms on woodor ivory. The slide rule is an analog computer which is still widely used byscientists and engineers throughout the entire world.<P><DD>	Shortly after Napier's achievements, around 1642, Blaise Pascal in Franceconstructed an adding machine that resembled the modern desk calculator. This machineconsisted of a series of ratchet-driven wheels with the numbers 0 to 9 on them.Although it was a simple device and could only add and subtract it embodied one veryimportant development which<A NAME="p009"><PRE><TABLE align=right><TD> <FONT SIZE=-1 Color=blue> Ord. Mono. 1961, CHAPTER I, starting page 009 <BR>Click here for <a href="U-S-Ord-61-009.tif">TIF version</A> of this page</FONT></TABLE>&nbsp;&nbsp;</PRE>is anessential part of the digital computing technique, namely a means of making the"carry over" into an automatic process. It also indicated the possibility ofmultiplying numbers by successive addition. For the first time a machine was builtthat approached automatic computing because it removed a function from the operatorto the machine.<P><DD>	In 1671 Gottfried Leibnitz, in Germany, invented the stepped-wheel, acylindrical drum having nine teeth of increasing length along its surface. When thedrum was rotated, a gear sliding on an axis parallel to that of the drum engaged someof the teeth, thereby undergoing a corresponding number of rotation steps. TheLeibnitz wheel made it possible to multiply quickly by repeated additions. From thenonwards a variety of improved calculating machines were devised, all based on theoriginal idea of wheels moved around in steps, and by the nineteenth centurycommercial models began to appear. The Thomas machine (France) embodied thisprinciple and, starting in 1822, was the first to be manufactured for widespread use.It was a dependable, crank-operated, four-process machine. In 1885 Burroughs, in theUnited States, produced an adding machine and in 1902 the first machine withcompletely automatic multiplication and division was built by Rechnitzer, also in theUnited States. Several machines were designed in various countries and by 1920, withthe fully automatic Monroe machine, we reach the stage of desk calculators familiarto us in banks, offices and laboratories. These are the machines that do most of theworld's computation, the modern ones being electrically driven and assuming more andmore of the operator's functions.<A NAME="p010"><PRE><TABLE align=right><TD> <FONT SIZE=-1 Color=blue> Ord. Mono. 1961, CHAPTER I, starting page 010 <BR>Click here for <a href="U-S-Ord-61-010.tif">TIF version</A> of this page</FONT></TABLE>&nbsp;&nbsp;</PRE><P><DD>	These machines, however, are limited in scope and require the constantattention of a human operator to supply them with numbers and to record on paperthe result of each stage of the calculation before proceeding to the next one. Theydo save time and mental effort but they are not fast enough where very largequantities of numerical data have to--be handled. ii must also be noted that they are not true forerunners of the modernelectronic computers.<P><DD>	The principles of modern computers, albeit in mechanical form, were laid down byCharles Babbage in England. Starting in 1812 he attempted to ' build an automaticmechanical calculator. He was familiar with Mullers idea for a difference engine(1786) and Jaques' idea for controlling a loom by means of punched holes (1775). Heincorporated both ideas and actually made models of a difference engine which was cardcontrolled. Technical problems of construction were too great for mechanicalengineering of that period and the computer was never finished. Later, Babbageconceived an even more ambitious idea. He worked on the design of an analyticalengine, which, had it been built, would have incorporated ideas familiar to the moderndigital computer.<P><DD>	Babbage's new idea was to extend the capabilities of the difference engine sothat it could not merely add and print, but also multiply, divide, and call for newdata from its human operator. In order for the analytical engine to perform the tasksexpected of it, it was necessary to express all the possible instructions to themachine in the form of stereotyped commands. Such a procedure is known as the logic orthe logical design<A NAME="p011"><PRE><TABLE align=right><TD> <FONT SIZE=-1 Color=blue> Ord. Mono. 1961, CHAPTER I, starting page 011 <BR>Click here for <a href="U-S-Ord-61-011.tif">TIF version</A> of this page</FONT></TABLE>&nbsp;&nbsp;</PRE> of acomputer, and Babbage's engine was strikingly modern in regard to its logical design.Except for the need of a human attendant to read into the machine values frommathematical tables, this engine was logically parallel to most of the recentautomatic computers. Naturally the speed of computation would have been far below thatof the modern calculator (it could perform one addition per second), since Babbage hadto use the purely mechanical techniques available in his day.<P><DD>	A significant part of his design for an analytical engine was the use of a"store" for holding the partial results of arithmetic operations performed in what hecalled the "mill". To feed numbers into the machine he proposed a system using patternsof holes punched in cards, while the results of calculations were to be presented by amechanism which would set up the appropriate numerals in type ready for printing.Another proposal was that the engine should be capable of deciding on a course ofaction in the light of partial results obtained. He called this the "control". Allthese ideas have become features of the modern digital computer, and it is mainlybecause of them that our present-day machines are so fast in operation and so versatilein their range of calculations.<P><DD>	The next important development along this line was made by Hollerith andPowers during 1880-1890. Working for the United States Census Bureau they requiredsome means of handling large masses of information. This led to the development ofthe first key punch, the first sorter, and the first tabulator, al) using largepunched cards. The patterns of round<A NAME="p012"><PRE><TABLE align=right><TD> <FONT SIZE=-1 Color=blue> Ord.

The cardscould be sorted into the series or order wanted, and then tabulated to reduce thecensus data to manageable form. Hollerith did not use the punched cards to controlthe course of computation, but simply used the holes in the cards to carryinformation. Hollerith and Powers also employed the electromagnetic techniques intheir machine, that is, information on the card (hole or no hole) was convertedinto electric impulses, and the electric impulses actuated devices known asrelays.<P><DD>	In 1925, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dr. Vannevar Bush and hisassociates began studying the problem of designing a machine to solve differentialequations. In 1927, Dr. Bush started work on a mechanical differential analyser. Heexperimented with mechanisms that would integrate, add, multiply, etc., and methods ofconnecting them together in a machine. Originally he made use of electrical currentsflowing through watt-hour meters, which integrate the electrical power absorbed bycircuits attached to them. Later he reverted to the mechanical integrators of thewheel and disc type. A major part of the success of the machine depended on a devicewhereby a very small turning force would do a rather large amount of work. By carefuldesign of the discs and of the wheel mountings, Dr. Bush was able to make theintegrators accurate, and, by introducing torque amplifiers to take the loads off thewheels so that they rotated very freely, he was able to reduce the slippage between<A NAME="p013"><PRE><TABLE align=right><TD> <FONT SIZE=-1 Color=blue> Ord. Mono. 1961, CHAPTER I, starting page 013 <BR>Click here for <a href="U-S-Ord-61-013.tif">TIF version</A> of this page</FONT></TABLE>&nbsp;&nbsp;</PRE>the wheel and the disc. He combined a frame with the integrators, whichcontained movable shafts, changeable gears and couplings, input hand-wheels and output recording pens for producing a readable result.<P><DD>	By 1930 the first differential analyser was finished. It was entirely mechanical, having no electrical parts except the motors. Its disadvantage was the great deal of work required in changing from one problemto another. This involved undoing old mechanical connections betweenshafts and setting up new ones. For this reason the design of a secondanalyser was begun in 1935, on which all connections could be made electrically.<P><DD>	As early as 1932 personnel of the Ballistic Section at Aberdeen Proving Ground had investigated the possible use of the Differential Analyserfor ballistic computations. The machine was used to compute numeroustrajectories including a set sufficient for the preparation of a completerange table. (t was also tested on interior ballistic problems. A careful study and evaluation of the results of this investigation led to thefollowing conclusions:<OL><P><LI>	 Such a machine could be built at Aberdeen Proving Ground.<P><LI>	  The machine could perform various kinds of ballistic computationswith the necessary accuracy.<P><LI>	  Operation and maintenance would require no unusual skill.<P><LI>	  The speed of the machine was such that it would insure greatlyincreased output of work by the Ballistic Section in any emergency.<A NAME="p014"><PRE><TABLE align=right><TD> <FONT SIZE=-1 Color=blue> Ord.

After final adjustment and trials itwas used in the computation of two firing tables. These were completed withgratifying results by mid 1936.<P><DD>	The Bush Differential Analyser, an analog device, was installed under thedirection of Major James Guion, who was in charge of the Ballistic Computing Sectionat Aberdeen Proving Ground at that time. Major Guion had been quick to realize thevalue of this continuous variable calculator to the Computational needs of theOrdnance Department. The Availability   of this machine and the experience thatwas gained in its use were invaluable to the Ordnance Department during the crucialtransition period prior to America's entry into World War 11.<P><DD>	The analyser installed at APG had ten integrating units and provisions fortwo input and two output tables. However, despite its value<A NAME="p015"><PRE><TABLE align=right><TD> <FONT SIZE=-1 Color=blue> Ord.

The torqueamplifier, for example, although simple in mechanical design, frequently failedtoward the end of a long trajectory run with the loss of the preceding computationand an appreciable delay associated with its repair. This type of failure and theinterference that it caused with the carrying out of computations at the BallisticResearch Laboratory led to extensive study to overcome this problem.<P><DD>	At the outbreak of World War II in Europe the officer in charge of ballisticcomputations at APG was. Lt. P. N. Gillon. He immediately recognized the immensity ofthe task that would fall upon the Ordnance Department in the event of United Statesparticipation in the war and this prompted him to seek both marked improvement inmechanical aids to computation and augmented facilities for its accomplishment. Anumber of very important things were undertaken to accomplish this purpose.<P><DD>	The Moore School of Electrical Engineering of the University of Pennsylvania hada Bush Differential Analyser of somewhat larger capacity than the one at AberdeenProving Ground. It had fourteen integrating units instead of ten. Therefore theOrdnance Department awarded a contract to the University of Pennsylvania for theutilization of this device. Several additional contracts were later awarded to theUniversity to carry out different phases of the increasingly important role which itwas to play in the computation activities of the Ordnance Department during the war.<A NAME="p016"><PRE><TABLE align=right><TD> <FONT SIZE=-1 Color=blue> Ord.

Gillon, in his capacity as officer in charge of ballisticcomputations, conferred frequently with Dean Pender, Professor Brainerd, and theirassociates at the Moore School in order to effect proper coordination of thecomputational work at the two localities, Philadelphia and Aberdeen. There was avery talented group at the Moore School under the direction of Professor Brainerdand as a result of Lt. Gillon's discussions with them Assistant Professor Weygandundertook to develop an electronic torque amplifier to replace the mechanicaltorque amplifiers on the Bush Differential Analysers. This work was eminentlysuccessful and, in addition, photoelectric followers were developed by the MooreSchool group for both the input and output tables of the analyser. As a result ofthese accomplishments the productive capacity of the analysers at both the MooreSchool and Aberdeen Proving Ground were enhanced by at least an order ofmagnitude.<P><DD>	During World War II the Bush Differential Analyser was used primarily tocompute trajectories for firing tables and to prepare trajectory charts for use withUT fuzes. The machine could compute a 60-second trajectory in about 15 minutes,whereas a human operator using a desk calculator required about 20 hours to performthe same computation. Its value to the Ordnance Department during the war years wastremendous.<P><DD>	The next major development, prior to the advent of the high-speed electronicautomatic computer, came in 1944 when Howard Aiken, in cooperation with some IBMengineers and some graduate students at Harvard University, completed the Mark IRelay Computer, also called the Automatic  Sequence-Controlled Calculator.	<A NAME="p017"><PRE><TABLE align=right><TD> <FONT SIZE=-1 Color=blue> Ord.

Its individual operations wereautomatic, once the punched tape fixing the chain of operations had been put onthe machine, and it was sequence-controlled, since control over the sequence ofits operations was built into the machine.	The principle of operation of the Mark I Relay Computer was electromechanical.It combined the two applications of the concept of state, that is, the informationfor processing was represented by patterns of open and closed relays (like thepatterns of holes and no holes which Babbage used).	Although the machine was efficient, fast, and capable of solving a varietyof problems its speed could not approach that of the electronic computer, whichis the next state in the development of computers and the subject of thismonograph. Nevertheless, it holds a permanent place in the history of developmentof calculating machines, since it was the first automatic machine to becompleted. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><DD>   BRL at APG used two types of relay computers during 1947-1954. Two IBM RelayCalculators were used for a short time but were not successful. Two Bell RelayComputers were used. They were accurate, but slow and required expert maintenance.Oust and humidity adversely affected their operation. However many useful results wereobtained from the twin Bell Relay Computers during many years of successful operation.One good feature of the Bell Relay Machines was that they would run 16 hoursovernight, unattended. A problem regularly would be placed on the computer at 4:00 PM.The next morning, arriving operating personnel would find the problem solved and themachine waiting, or the machine still feverishly running the problem to a<A NAME="p018">	<PRE><TABLE align=right><TD> <FONT SIZE=-1 Color=blue> Ord.

Many times, if it was felt that the machines would completea problem during the night, a new problem was set before the machine for it totackle until personnel arrived the next morning. This mode of operation increasedthe productivity of the computers with a minimum of personnel. Of course, once ina while a dirty relay would cause a stoppage, for the Bell A and the Bell B wouldeither run without error or not run at all.</BLOCKQUOTE> <P><HR><P>  Go 	<A HREF="U-S-Ord-61-ch03.html">forward</A> -> next chapter<P> If you have comments or suggestions, 	<A HREF="e_mail.html">Send e-mail</A> to Ed Thelen<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="index.html">Go to Antique Computer home page</A>,Go to <A HREF="on-line-docs.html#Architecture">On-line Documents</A><BR> 	</BODY></HTML>
