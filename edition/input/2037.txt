Raven<br>Director, Missouri Botanical Gardens</h2>      <p><img src="img/greenO.gif" width="50" height="70" align="left">pinions vary widely on the numbers of people that individual areas, or         the world as a whole, can support, and objective analyses of the relationships         that exist between population and the environment are few and far between.         In view of this lack of readily available, clearly presented information,         this volume fills an important void. Its graphics, analyses and discussions         of individual ecosystems provide the kind of basis that any educated person         would like to have in approaching this subject or in acting intelligently         in many areas of modern life. It is thus a most welcome contribution to         the growing body of literature about the environment, focusing exclusively         on what is clearly the key area of concern.</p>      <p>As our numbers continue to grow, with increasing pressure on the environment         everywhere, it becomes more and more important to understand in as much         depth as possible the many and diverse aspects of this set of relationships.         In this volume, you will find them laid out in a way that is graphically         appealing, clear, consistent with contemporary thought on the issues and         readily accessible to the intelligent lay person. In doing so, the book         makes a contribution that is exceedingly timely, one that will lead to         further analyses and reflection on the part of individuals, governments         and corporations, as the authors have clearly intended.</p>      <p>Although it has long seemed obvious that there is an important linkage         between such factors as human population density, rate of growth, consumption         and the choice of particular technologies on the one hand, and the state         of the environment on the other, the quantitative analysis of such relationships         has by no means been adequately pursued, and they are often poorly understood         and represented. For these reasons, it is of great importance to make         what we do know accessible to both specialist and broader audiences, as         a basis for developing theory further and for making the best decisions         we can now. Although it is difficult to view the pertinent facts clearly         and without bias, it is evident that no relationships are more important         for us to understand as we strive to create a sustainable world for the         21st century and beyond. General statements, speculation and intuitive         deductions about the impacts of various aspects of human population on         the environment are no longer sufficient as a basis for effective action,         and additional empirical evidence and analyses are badly needed. This         book does not attempt such analyses, but rather endeavors to establish         a common base of understanding about what is known in this area. In doing         so, it makes an important contribution.</p>      <p>In its opening chapters, this book illustrates the various ways in which         population factors, such as rates of growth, absolute growth, consumption,         migration and the application of various technologies, affect both in         the short term and more enduringly the health of the world&#146;s ecosystems.         Here, Paul Harrison presents an overview of exceptional clarity concerning         the relationship between population dynamics and the environment. This         treatment does not represent original research, but rather is a presentation         of contemporary thinking and data. The extensive use of graphics makes         every page a rich source of easily understood facts and figures about         the central relationships that this book explores. </p>      <p>The balance of the book presents an extensive series of analyses of individual         habitats throughout the world, considering in depth what is known about         the ways in which they are impacted by pressures associated with population.         This is a feature that will provide useful insights in many areas and         for many different people.</p>      <p>One of the most difficult aspects of providing sound analyses of these         relationships in the past has been the difficulty of linking the social         and natural sciences. Here, however, we find the issues presented in a         multidimensional fashion, demonstrating the cross connections between         human and natural environmental factors in determining a particular outcome.         In such an area, the AAAS, which brings together the wide array of all         the sciences, has a comparative advantage, and is particularly suited         to undertake interdisciplinary studies. </p>      <p>Where do we stand in our efforts to achieve a sustainable world? Clearly,         the past half century has been a traumatic one, as the collective impact         of human numbers, affluence (consumption per individual) and our choices         of technology continue to exploit rapidly an increasing proportion of         the world's resources at an unsustainable rate. Ehrlich and Holdren's         IPAT relationship, discussed in the second chapter of this book, lies         at the heart of understanding the population-environment relationship         and needs to be understood both in terms of the amount of resources necessary         to produce each unit of consumption, and also the amount of waste or pollution         generated in the process. At any event, during a remarkably short period         of time, we have lost a quarter of the world's topsoil and a fifth         of its agricultural land, altered the composition of the atmosphere profoundly,         and destroyed a major proportion of our forests and other natural habitats         without replacing them. Worst of all, we have driven the rate of biological         extinction, the permanent loss of species, up several hundred times beyond         its historical levels, and are threatened with the loss of a majority         of all species by the end of the 21st century.</p>      <p>As George Schaller, the noted conservationist, has put it, &quot;We cannot         afford another century like this one&quot; (i.e., the 20th century). As         the new millennium begins, human beings are estimated to be consuming         directly, wasting or diverting more than 40 percent of the total net terrestrial         photosynthetic productivity, and to be using about 55 percent of the world's         renewable supplies of freshwater. Median World Bank estimates, however,         have the human population increasing by another 50 percent over the next         half century, before leveling off at perhaps 10 billion people by the         year 2100. Trends over the past decades, which indicate a slowing in overall         population growth, support these projections, but it is clear that our         population will not, in fact, reach stability unless we find effective         ways to continue to address growth and to achieve goals that we have selected.       </p>      <p>At the same time, levels of consumption are rising throughout the world,         even though it has been estimated that if everyone in the world were to         live in the way we do in the United States, it would require three more         planets comparable to Earth to support them. The notion that development         will eventually lead all of the world's people to achieve standards         of consumption comparable to those enjoyed in our country, using the technologies         we have available now, is clearly inaccurate; and yet it implicitly underlies         many of our actions, thoughts and aspirations. We live in a world in which         the World Health Organization considers that half of us are malnourished         at some level, taking into account vitamins, minerals and calories, and         one in which one in four people survives on less than a dollar per day.         It is not a world in which conditions will be improved by wishful thinking,         but only by concrete action, based on the kind of understanding that this         book will help to make possible. </p>      <p>The realization that the peoples of the world, rich and poor, are interdependent,         and that the rich have a responsibility to help the poor and that they         will need to do so in order to be able to achieve overall stability, is         a relatively recent one, coming into focus with the formation of the United         Nations following the Second World War, and especially with the 1972 Stockholm         conference on the global environment. Much has been written about these         matters over the past few decades, and when the nations of the world came         together at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, it was hoped that         effective action could be taken to address the complex needs involved         in building a sustainable world, and particularly the ways in which social         justice was necessary both morally and as a condition of forming such         a world. Day by day, this is becoming more important as more and more         people make larger and larger demands on relatively static types and amounts         of resources. </p>      <p>In view of the complex relationships presented in the pages of this book,         it evidently is not feasible to estimate the Earth's carrying capacity         for people as an absolute. Rather, it is the complex relationship between         population density, consumption and choice of technology, together with         the choices that we make about the quality of life, that will determine         the number of people that an individual area, or the Earth as a whole,         can support sustainably. The diversity of our planet is decreasing rapidly,         and has done so dramatically for the past 400 generations, since crop         agriculture and the domestication of animals provided the means for building         villages, towns and cities, and gave rise to the complex human societies         in which the manifold activities that we call civilization take place.         The question that the relationships presented in this book bring into         focus is one of choice: what kind of world do we wish to have and to leave         for our children and grandchildren, all those who come after us. Human         populations will attain sustainability, but will it be sustainability         marked by dull, monotonous, unhealthy landscapes, or one in which the         biological and cultural riches that we enjoy in the early years of the         21st century will be maintained and enhanced, sources of material and         spiritual enrichment for everyone? </p>      <p>In making the many choices involved in constructing the world of the         future, we must go far beyond the mechanical calculations of an Adam Smith         to the vision of a Gandhi, who said, &quot;The world contains enough to         satisfy every man's need, but never enough for our greed.&quot; It         is absolutely necessary to adopt a spiritual approach if we want the world         of the future to be a nurturing one, filled with variety of all kinds;         but it is not sufficient to have such an attitude to understand what we         must do to achieve this goal. In order to do so, we must understand the         relationships that are so well presented in the present volume in a way         that will inform the debate for years to come. </p>      <p>One puts down this book feeling a debt of gratitude to the authors, editors         and those who prepared the illustrations for the enlightenment and feeling         of rational hope that they have conveyed by laying out the realities of         the all-important population-environment relationship so clearly, comprehensively         and well. In order to build a better, more prosperous and healthier life         for our children and all those who will come after us, we all badly need         the kind of clarity of understanding that this very welcome book represents.         Given that understanding and our commitment to deal effectively and well         with our own future, we shall certainly be able to succeed beyond our         most optimistic assumptions.</p><p align="center"> [<a href="pdf/foreword.pdf">Download article as PDF</a>]</p>	<table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="3">	<tr><td align="right">	[<a href="index.php?sub=intro">Introduction</a>]</td>	<td align="right">	<a href="index.php?sub=intro"><img src="img/arrowprev.gif" width="23" height="23" border="0"></a>	</td><td align="left">	<a href="index.php?part=1&sec=scale"><img src="img/arrownext.gif" width="23" height="23" border="0"></a>	</td><td align="left">	[<a href="index.php?part=1&sec=scale">Scale</a>]	</td></tr></table>  	</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="150">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>    <td bgcolor="#999999" width="1"><br></td>    <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="150">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>    <td bgcolor="#999999" width="1"><br></td>    <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table></body></html>
