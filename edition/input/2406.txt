Knowingly or unknowingly,ancient farmers selected for pest resistance genes in their crops, sometimesby actions as simple as collecting seed from only the highestyielding plantsin their fields.</font><p><font size="-1">With the advent of genetic engineering, genes for insectresistance now can be moved into plants more quickly and deliberately.Bt technology is only one example of ways genetic engineering may be usedto develop insect resistant crops now and in the future.</font><h2><b>The Bt Chapter</b></h2><font size="-1">Bacillus thuringiensis, commonly known as Bt, is a bacteriumthat occurs naturally in the soil. For years, bacteriologists have knownthat some strains of Bt produce proteins that kill certain insects withalkaline digestive tracts. When these insects ingest the protein producedby Bt, the function of their digestive systems is disrupted, producingslow growth and, ultimately, death.</font><p><font size="-1">Bt is very selective - different strains of the bacteriumkill different insects and only those insects. Strains of Bt are effectiveagainst European corn borers and cotton bollworms (Lepidoptera), Coloradopotato beetles (Coleoptera), and certain flies and mosquitos (Diptera).Bt is not harmful to humans, other mammals, birds, fish, or beneficialinsects.</font><p><font size="-1">Bt was first identified in 1911 when it was discoveredthat it killed the larvae of flour moths. Bt was registered as a biopesticidein the U.S. in 1961. Today it is used in insecticide sprays sold to homegardeners and others worldwide.</font><p><font size="-1">In 1983, the World Health Organization used Bt in WestAfrica to control disease-carrying blackflies. In the U.S., various strainsof Bt are used to control spruce budworms and gypsy moths in forests, cabbageworms in broccoli and cauliflower, loopers or budworms in cotton and tobacco,and leaf rollers in fruits.</font><p><font size="-1">However, less than one percent of all pesticides usedin the U.S. each year contain Bt (Monsanto). As an ingredient of commercialsprays, Bt is relatively expensive and has some drawbacks. Although somepesticides kill on contact, Bt must be eaten by insects to be effective.Sunlight breaks down Bt, and rain washes it from the plants. Therefore,Bt must be applied exactly where and when the target insects are feedingand they must consume it quickly before it disappears.</font><h2><b>Bt and Biotechnology</b></h2><font size="-1">Today, plants can be genetically engineered to produce theirown Bt. Genetic (recombinant DNA) engineering is the modification of DNAmolecules to produce changes in plants, animals, or other organisms. DNA(deoxyribonucleic acid) is a double-stranded molecule that is present inevery cell of an organism and contains the hereditary information thatpasses from parents to offspring. This hereditary information is containedin individual units or sections of DNA called genes. The genes that arepassed from parent to offspring determine the traits that the offspringwill have.</font><p><font size="-1">In the last twenty years, scientists made a surprisingdiscovery - DNA is interchangeable among animals, plants, bacteria ...any organism! In addition to using traditional breeding methods of improvingplants and animals through years of crossbreeding and selection, scientistscan now isolate the gene or genes for the traits they want in one animalor plant and move them into another. Of course, when a trait is controlledby several genes, the transfer process is more difficult. The plants oranimals modified in this way are called transgenic.</font><h2><b>Out of Bt. . .</b> <b>Into the Plants</b></h2><font size="-1">DNA technology makes it possible to locate the gene thatproduces Bt proteins lethal to insects and transfer the gene into cropplants. The process is depicted in Figure 1.</font><p><font size="-1">First, scientists identify a strain of Bt that kills thetargeted insect. Then they isolate the gene that produces the lethal protein.That gene is removed from the Bt bacterium and a gene conferring resistanceto a chemical (usually antibiotic or herbicide) is attached that will proveuseful in a later step.</font><p><font size="-1">The Bt gene with the resistance gene attached is insertedinto plant cells. At this point, scientists must determine which plantcells have successfully received the Bt gene and are now transformed. Anyplant cell that has the Bt gene must also have the resistance gene thatwas attached to it. Researchers grow the plant cells in the presence ofthe antibiotic or herbicide and select the plant cells that are unaffectedby it. These genetically transformed plant cells are then grown into<b></b>whole plants by a process called tissue culture. The modified plantsproduce the same lethal Bt protein produced by Bt bacteria because theplants now have the same gene.</font><p><font size="-1">Research to transfer insect resistance genes from Bt tocrop plants is well under way. Corn, cotton, and potatoes are three ofthe many commercial crops targeted for Bt insect resistance.</font><p>&nbsp;<center><img src="/web/20130121073949im_/http://www.aces.uiuc.edu/vista/html_pubs/biotech/fig1.gif"></center><center>Figure 1</center><h2><b>Bt in Corn Confers Resistance to European Corn Borers</b></h2><font size="-1">Modern corn hybrids have some resistance to European cornborers (ECB), but they still sustain damage from moderate and high levelsof infestation. Genetically engineered insect-resistant corn is providinga new defense against an old enemy.</font><h3><b>The Enemy</b></h3><font size="-1">The European corn borer is a major pest of corn in North<b></b>America and Europe. Researchers estimate that yield loss due to ECBaverages five percent, but any one year or location can have much higherdamage (Ciba Seeds). The number of larvae in the previous season, the typeof winter weather, natural parasites and disease, and weather conditionsduring the growing season can affect ECB levels. For example, during the1990 and 1991 growing seasons, ECB levels were very high across much ofthe U.S. Corn Belt and losses were heavy. But the cool, rainy weather anddiseases during critical parts of the 1992 growing season reduced ECB populationsand their damage in many areas.</font><p><font size="-1">ECB larvae attack corn two times during the growing seasonacross most of the U.S. Corn Belt. First-brood larvae feed on plant leavesbefore flowering, injure leaf tissue, and eventually bore into the stalk.Second-brood larvae begin feeding in the leaf sheath and collar area ofcorn plants after flowering. Eventually, they bore into the stalk and earshank where they can cause broken stalks and dropped ears.</font><p><font size="-1">The greatest source of ECB damage may not be visible.ECB disrupts the physiological processes of corn and can reduce yieldseven when stalk lodging (breaking) problems are not evident. Physiologicaldamage can cause low test weight of harvested corn, small ears, or earlydeath of the plant.</font><p><font size="-1">Chemical sprays must be<b> </b>applied before the borertunnels into the stalk to be effective. Multiple applications may be required,and, even then, complete control is not possible.</font><h3><b>The Bt Solution</b></h3><font size="-1">Scientists know that a family of insecticidal proteins fromBt kills ECB. The bacteria produce the protein as an insoluble crystal.When a susceptible caterpillar, like the corn borer, eats the crystal,part of it binds to, penetrates, and collapses the cells lining its gut,causing death.</font><p><font size="-1">Although Bt genes have been introduced into tobacco, tomatoes,cotton, and other broadleaf plants, gene transfer technology for corn isa recent achievement. The development of corn plants expressing Bt proteinsrequires substantial changes in the Bt genes, including the creation ofsynthetic versions of the genes, rather than the microbial Bt gene itself.</font><p><font size="-1">For example, one company has developed three versionsof a synthetic Bt gene that "switches" on in pollen, in green tissue, orin other parts of the corn plant (Ciba Seeds). Along with a herbicide resistancegene, the three Bt<b> </b>versions were "shot" by a biolistic gene guninto immature corn embryos taken from developing seeds about 15 days afterpollination. The gene gun bombarded the embryos with tiny gold particlescoated with the genes.</font><p><font size="-1">Some plants received genes with a non-specific promoter(switch) that resulted in production of the Bt protein in many parts ofthe corn plant. Other plants received a mixture of genes with switchesthat resulted in Bt protein production only in the pollen and green tissue.The herbicide resistance gene allowed scientists to determine which plantcells had received a gold particle carrying DNA and successfully incorporatedthe gene. Subsequent screening for Bt production showed which cells receivedboth herbicide resistance and the Bt gene(s).</font><p><font size="-1">When the cells were grown into plants and field testedfor resistance, it was found that the Bt plants fared better than any ofthe control plants. In general, plants with both the pollen and green tissueBt genes appeared more resistant to second-brood corn borer damage thanplants with Bt genes that expressed<b> </b>themselves in many parts ofthe plant. Another advantage of the Bt genes with specific switches (pollenand green tissue) was that they produced insecticidal protein in thoseparts of the plant attacked by both first-and secondbrood ECBs, while minimizingproduction in seed and other parts of the plant where protection is notcritical.</font><p><font size="-1">Using Bt technology to control corn borers is an internationaleffort. One U.S. company is using a biolistic gene gun to bombard Indonesiancorn with Bt genes that produce proteins lethal to the Asian corn borer(Wilson). This pest is responsible for significant yield losses, up to40 percent, in much of the corn-growing areas of Indonesia.</font><p><font size="-1">The warm Indonesian climate and the life cycle of theAsian corn borer allow 9 to 12 overlapping generations annually, makingit a threat to corn virtually year-round. Introducing Bt insect resistancegenes into commercial Indonesian corn seems to be the most feasible andeffective way available to control the pest.</font><p><font size="-1">Comprehensive testing must be done, approval by relevantauthorities obtained, and patent questions answered before any companycan commercialize corn hybrids containing the Bt gene.</font><p>&nbsp;<center><img src="/web/20130121073949im_/http://www.aces.uiuc.edu/vista/html_pubs/biotech/fig2.gif"></center><center>The corn on the left is resistant to European corn borers, thanksto Bt technology. The corn plant on the right is not.</center><h2><b>Bt Resistance for the Colorado Potato Beetle</b></h2><font size="-1">The potato is the most popular vegetable among North Americanconsumers. It is estimated that potatoes, in some form, are consumed duringone of every three meals (Monsanto). Despite their popularity, potatoesare not that easy to grow. Each year, potato growers lose a significantamount of their crops to an insect called the Colorado potato beetle. Thebeetle feeds on the growing plant leaves and stems during the growing season,stunting the<b> </b>plant and cutting yields. Repeated applications ofchemical sprays are usually needed to control the pest.</font><h3><b>The Economic Picture</b></h3><font size="-1">According to the USDA, potato producers in the U.S. spend$20 to $40 million each year for control of the Colorado potato beetle(Monsanto). In an average year, growers spray their fields with insecticidesas many as five times at a cost of up to $150 per acre.</font><p><font size="-1">If insect-resistant plants were available, researchersestimate that the use of chemical insecticides in potatoes could be reducedas much as 30 to 40 percent. Translated into dollars, growers could save$6 to $16 million annually, based on USDA<b> </b>estimates of current insecticideuse.</font><h3><b>Similar Science, Different Target</b></h3><font size="-1">The science being used to develop potatoes resistant to theColorado potato beetle is similar to the European corn borer technology.One of the advantages of Bt is the diversity of strains that can be usedto target different insect pests.</font><p><font size="-1">Like the corn researchers, potato scientists are usinga specific type of the naturally occurring soil bacterium Bacillus <i>thuringiensis.</i>A single gene from the Bt is spliced into a chromosome of a potatocell. When the cell carrying the Bt gene is grown into a plant, the plantproduces a protein that is toxic to the Colorado potato beetle. When thebeetle feeds on the genetically improved plant, the toxic protein interfereswith its digestive system and it dies.</font><p><font size="-1">The protein is highly selective, affecting only the Coloradopotato beetle. It does not harm humans, animals, or beneficial insectsthat help control other crop pests.</font><h3><b>The Outlook</b></h3><font size="-1">One company conducting insect-resistant potato research expectsfarmers to be planting their beetle-resistant potatoes by the mid-1990s(Monsanto news release). This company began its development of insect-resistantpotatoes with the Russet Burbank variety, since it comprises approximately40 percent of U.S. potato acreage. However, company researchers are alsoworking to improve other popular potato varieties such as Atlantic, Superior,Norchip, and Shepody.</font><p><font size="-1">Like all genetically improved food crops, the exact timetablefor commercialization of insectresistant potatoes depends not only on thescientific tests that must be conducted, but also on approvals by the appropriateregulatory agencies. (See Regulating Bt Plants.)</font><p>&nbsp;<center><img src="/web/20130121073949im_/http://www.aces.uiuc.edu/vista/html_pubs/biotech/fig3.gif"></center><center>The potato plant on the left did not produce the Bt protein toprotect it form the Colorado potato beetle. The plant on the right hadthe Bt gene.</center><h2><b>Bt Resistance for Cotton</b></h2><font size="-1">Cotton is another cash crop benefiting from Bt insect-resistanceresearch. With a market value of $4.5 billion, cotton is the nation's fifthlargest crop (Monsanto). Yet, annually cotton growers expect to lose upto 15 percent of each field due to insect damage.</font><p><font size="-1">Caterpillar insects, like the tobacco budworm, cottonbollworm, and pink bollworm, feed on cotton plants. Experts say that theseand similar pests are responsible for millions of dollars in damage tothe American cotton crop each year.</font><h3><b>Caterpillar Economics</b></h3><font size="-1">Caterpillar insects are responsible for 60 to 70 percentof all insect damage to cotton plants (Monsanto). Efforts to control themchemically account for about 60 to 70 percent of a cotton grower's pesticidecosts. In the Mississippi Delta growing region, a cotton grower's pesticidecosts can average $40 to $45 per acre each season. In Arizona, pest controlcosts are usually higher, perhaps double that of the Mississippi Delta.</font><p><font size="-1">Chemical sprays containing Bt are seldom practical incotton, since Bt breaks down in sunlight, washes away in rain, and is nearlyimpossible to apply to the plant parts where insects feed. However, otherchemical insecticides are used that may need to be applied as many as 10times in one season. By planting insectresistant cotton, researchers hopefarmers can reduce the number of insecticide applications they must payfor.</font><h3><b>Same Song, Third Verse</b></h3><font size="-1">Creating insect resistance in cotton by using Bt technologyis a procedure similar to that used in corn or potatoes. Researchers findone or more strains of Bt that produce a protein fatal to some of the mostdamaging cotton insect pests. The gene that regulates the protein's productionis inserted into the genetic structure of cells from a cotton plant. Thecells that successfully receive the Bt genes are grown into whole plantsthrough tissue culture and enter a long period of laboratory and fieldtesting. When certain caterpillar pests feed on the new cotton plants,the protein damages their digestive systems, and they die.</font><h3><b>Commercialization Timetable</b></h3><font size="-1">Current estimates are that it will be several years beforeinsectresistant cotton plants are commercially marketed. They must meetthe regulatory requirements administered by the USDA and the EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA). (See <b>Regulating Bt Plants.)</b></font><h2><b>The Insect Resistance Problem</b></h2><font size="-1">Transgenic Bt plants like corn, potatoes, and cotton havea possible problem - what if insects build up a resistance to the lethalproteins?</font><p><font size="-1">The potential of pests to develop resistance against thedefense mechanisms of crops is well-known and is not unique to geneticallyengineered plants. Insects may develop resistance to a crop defense nomatter how it was developed. The crop defense might be a chemical or biologicalagent, a gene already in the crop species and transferred to commercialplants by conventional plant breeding methods, or a gene introduced byrecombinant DNA technology. Because more than 500 insects and mites alreadyhave acquired resistance to a number of insecticides, there is concernthat similar resistance to Bt toxins could develop (McGaughey and Whalon).</font><p><font size="-1">Several major pests, including the tobacco budworm, Coloradopotato beetle, Indianmeal moth, and diamondback moth, have demonstratedthe ability to adapt to Bt in the laboratory. It has been reported thatthe diamondback moth evolved high levels of resistance in the field asa result of repeated use of Bt (McGaughey and Whalon). As Bt use increaseson more acres, some scientists predict that insect resistance to Bt willbe a major problem. Considerable controversy exists about how Bt shouldbe managed to prolong its usefulness.</font><h3><b>Bt Durability in Non-Transgenic Crops</b></h3><font size="-1">The crystal proteins of Bt that are lethal to insects havebeen widely used as microbial insecticides in traditional corn and vegetablecrops for years. In recent years, field populations of insects tolerantto these Bt proteins have been reported. To date, these cases are limitedand have been associated with frequent and prolonged use of Bt on geographicallyisolated insect populations (Ciba Seeds). Scientists have been able toinduce higher levels of resistance in these field populations by takingthem into the laboratory and exposing them to specific Bt insecticidalcrystal proteins.</font><p><font size="-1">A laboratory population of tobacco budworm that is resistantto more than one class of crystal proteins has been reported. However,the resistance of this population is not high and its ability to surviveis significantly reduced when the proteins are absent.</font><p><font size="-1">In the case of ECB-resistant corn, it is thought thatthe development of insect resistance may be delayed by the availabilityof non-Bt corn fields (refuges) that are still susceptible to the borers.Borers that could not survive ECB-resistant fields may do well in the refuges.There they could breed with resistant borers, diluting the resistance traitin the gene pool.</font><p>&nbsp;<center><img src="/web/20130121073949im_/http://www.aces.uiuc.edu/vista/html_pubs/biotech/fig4.gif"></center><center>The large boll of cotton on the left was produced by a plant designedwith a Bt gene to fent of insects. The smaller boll on the right was grownin the same field on an unprotected plant.</center><h3><b>Bt Durability in Transgenic Crops</b></h3><font size="-1">About 13 U.S. and European companies that fund academic Btresearch have formed a Bt Management Working Group to support researchon the interaction of transgenic plants with target pests.</font><p><font size="-1">The plant industry is employing several approaches todeal with insect resistance to transgenic insecticidal plants, includingthe following:</font><p><font size="-1"><b>Very high levels of insecticidal crystal proteins </b>(ICPs)are being produced in new genetically modified plants. The only insectsthat can survive feeding on such plants will be those that already possessa high-level resistance gene as part of their genetic code. Such genesare expected to be extremely rare in the insect population. Insects withmore common genes for partial, or lowlevel, resistance will not survivethe very high levels of ICPs.</font><p><font size="-1"><b>Additional insecticidal genes </b>are being sought.The idea is to develop transgenic plants that express several insecticidalgenes targeting different sites within the insect. In order to surviveplants with such multiple defenses, an insect would probably have to possessmultiple resistance genes. Some scientists believe it is highly unlikelythat insects can acquire such genes. In any case, these scientists anticipatethat plants expressing additional insecticidal genes will be availablebefore insect resistance to a single, highly expressed ICP from Bt develops.</font><h2><b>Regulating Bt Plants</b></h2><font size="-1">Insect-resistant crops developed through Bt technology aresubject to the same regulations as other genetically engineered plants.It should be noted that U.S. regulatory policy for genetically engineeredplants has evolved over time and additional changes in the requirementsdiscussed below may occur. Three government agencies share responsibilityfor administering plant biotechnology regulations in the United States.</font><h3><b>U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)</b></h3><font size="-1">The USDA administers the Federal Plant Pest Act (FPPA), whichregulates interstate movement, importation, and field testing of geneticallyengineered plants. A special permit from the USDA and approval by the individualstate departments of agriculture are required to move any genetically engineeredorganism into the U.S. or between states. Applicants for a permit mustprovide details about the nature of the organism, its origin, and its intendeduse. If granted, the permit certifies that the applicant's facility andprocedures meet certain operating standards, such as appropriate levelsof containment to prevent accidental escape of the organism. Guidelinesset by the National Institutes of Health for laboratory research involvingrecombinant DNA molecules are included in these standards and must be followedby the applicant.</font><p><font size="-1">The USDA oversees field testing of genetically engineeredcrops. The applicant must provide complete information about the plant,including all new genes and new gene products, their origin, the purposeof the test, the experimental design (how the test will be conducted),and precautions to be taken to prevent the escape of pollen, plants, orplant parts from the field test site. The approval process can take a maximumof four months.</font><p><font size="-1">Before a genetically engineered crop can be sold commercially,a petition must be filed for USDA exemption. This petition requires moreinformation than a field test permit, including environmental product safetyinformation.</font><p><font size="-1">Recently, the USDA streamlined the permit process formovement and field testing of certain genetically engineered crops suchas corn, soybeans, cotton, potatoes, tomatoes, and tobacco. The streamliningwas based on an extensive history of safe use in field trials in the UnitedStates. In the streamlined process, an applicant can field test specificcrops if the crop and genetic material meet certain USDA performance standards.For a field test that does not meet these performance standards, the current120-day field test permit process would be followed.</font><h3><b>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</b></h3><font size="-1">The EPA recently proposed new policies for review of applicationsfor field trials of genetically engineered plants. It proposed that substancesintroduced into crops by genetic engineering to provide disease or insectresistance (Bt crops are in this category) fall under the Federal Insecticide,Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and CosmeticAct.</font><p><font size="-1">To date, the USDA has consulted with EPA when reviewingapplications to test such crops on a small scale. The EPA will most likelyformally review a product when a company decides to move into large-scaletesting. As with traditional pesticides, an Experimental Use Permit (EUP)will be required for tests that exceed 10 acres total in the U.S.</font><p><font size="-1">After receiving the EUP, a company follows a process thatinvolves extensive testing of the crop to ensure food and environmentalsafety before the crop is commercialized. In addition, it is likely thatsome applicants also will consult the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)before a pest-resistant food crop is commercialized, even though a recentFDA policy proposal emphasized that such products fall under the EPA'sjurisdiction and are not subject to FDA pre-market approval.</font><h3><b>Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</b></h3><font size="-1">The FDA also has very broad authority under the Federal Food,Drug, and Cosmetic Act to regulate the introduction of new food crops,whether they were conventionally produced or created by genetic engineering.FDA policy states that any new food developed through genetic modificationmay require testing and/or labeling if the genetic material introducedinto the host plant comes from outside the traditional food supply, isa known or suspected cause of allergic reactions, or significantly altersthe nutritional composition of the food <i>(Federal Register). </i>Everycompany or individual that produces food or food products through recombinantDNA technology is legally required to assure its safety and quality beforeit enters the food supply - the same assurance required of traditionalfood products.</font><h3><b>The Bt Outlook</b></h3><font size="-1">Crops that have been genetically engineered for Bt resistancecould dramatically lower production costs and provide farmers with newinsect control options within the next few years. The success of theircommercialization depends on several factors, including the regulatoryclimate, patent issues, and the ability of scientists to deal with targetedinsects that develop resistance to the lethal proteins. Several companiescurrently working on Bt insect resistance in crops foresee marketing theirproducts in the mid1990s.</font><h2><b>References</b></h2><ul><li><font size="-1">Ciba Seeds.
