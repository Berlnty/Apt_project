Biological control can occurspontaneously due to native natural enemies, can be applied bypeople, or can be fortuitous, that is, due to accidental introductionof natural enemies.<P>Most biological control of the introduced gypsy moth, <U>Lymantria</U><U>dispar</U> (L.), in the United States has been applied, followinga classical approach using parasites.  This approach involvessearching for parasites in native habitats of the gypsy moth,importing them, and releasing them in the hope that they willbecome established in this country and exert biological controlon gypsy moth populations.  Use of augmentation, which is themanipulation of natural enemies by people for more immediate control,has been minimal against the gypsy moth.<P>This paper give background material on the gypsy moth, and describesthe effect of pathogens, parasites, and predators on gypsy mothpopulations.<P><A NAME="about"><B><U>About the Gypsy Moth</B></U><P>The gypsy moth caterpillar is a serious defoliator of broadleavedforests in eastern North America.  In addition, this pest defoliatestrees and shrubs in residential areas causing economic and aestheticimpacts and, when infestations are heavy, creates a nuisance toresidents.  Caterpillars prefer hardwoods, but may feed on severalhundred different species of trees and shrubs.  During periodswhen gypsy moth populations are dense, larvae feed on almost allvegetation.  Trees weakened by consecutive defoliation are vulnerableto attack by disease organisms and other insects.  For example,the <U>Armillaria</U> fungus attacks the roots of weakened trees,and the two-lined chestnut borer attacks the trunk and branches.<P><A NAME="life"><B><U>Life Cycle</U></B><P>The gypsy moth has one generation per year passing through fourlife stages:  egg, caterpillar, pupa, and adult (moth stage) (Figure1).  Only the caterpillar which reach maturity between mid-Juneand early July defoliate trees and shrubs.  After 6 to 8 weeks,the caterpillar enters the pupal stage for 7 to 14 days, whichchanges into adults (moths).  Flightless female moths mate andlay their eggs in masses in July and August.  Four to six weekslater, embryos develop into caterpillars.  The caterpillars remainin the eggs during the winter.  The caterpillars emerge from theeggs the following spring, coinciding with budding of most broadleavedtrees (McManus et al 1989).<P><A NAME="distribution"><B><U>Distribution</U></B><P>The gypsy moth is not native to North America but was introducedfrom Europe in 1869 near  Boston, Massachusetts.  Historically,populations of the gypsy moth have undergone periodic outbreaksto extremely high densities that resulted in widespread defoliationto an average of 3.0 million forested acres per year.  More recently(1992 through 1996), populations have been declining to an averageof 1.0 million forested acres per year partly due to the rapidspread of an introduced fungus (Figure 2).<P>Since the introduction of the European or North American strainof gypsy moth, it has spread  south and west, and continues tospread along the leading edge of infestation at the rate of approximately12 miles per year (Figure 3).  The Asian strain of gypsy mothwas recently  introduced on the East and West coasts of NorthAmerica and eradicated.<P><A NAME="bcgypsy"><B><U>Biological Control of the Gypsy Moth</U></B><P>Pathogens -- In eastern North America, the gypsy moth is subjectto a variety of naturally occurring infectious diseases causedby several kinds of pathogens -- bacteria, fungi, and a nucleopolyhedrosisvirus (NPV).  The NPV, which was inadvertently introduced withthe gypsy moth or its parasites, and an introduced fungus <U>Entomophaga</U><U>maimaiga</U> cause widespread mortality and are described here.  The other pathogens cause only limited mortality.  <P><A NAME="virus"><B><U>Virus</U></B><P>The naturally occurring disease caused by the NPV is often referredto as &quot;wilt&quot; due to the soft, limp appearance of thediseased larvae (Figure 4).  The disease can reach outbreak (epizootic)proportions as gypsy moth population densities increase.  Theseoutbreaks result from increased transmission rates, within andbetween generations of the gypsy moth, as small caterpillars becomeinfected and die on leaves in the crowns of trees.  These caterpillarcadavers disintegrate and serve as inocula for healthy feedingcaterpillars.  Also, virus transmission occurs when adult femalesdeposit their egg masses on NPV-contaminated surfaces.  Caterpillarshatching from these contaminated eggs in the following springhave a high risk of contracting the disease.  Birds and mammalshave the ability to pass and disperse active gypsy moth NPV, andparasites and invertebrate predators may play a role in the transmissionof gypsy moth NPV within natural populations.  In many dense gypsymoth populations, the virus kills up to 95% of the larvae andreduces populations to levels where they cause only minimal defoliationand tree damage in the following year (Reardon and Podgwaite 1992).<P>In the late 1950's, the USDA Forest Service began to explore thefeasibility of developing this pathogen as an alternative to chemicalinsecticides for suppressing gypsy moth populations.  In April1978, the gypsy moth nucleopolyhedrosis virus product Gypchekwas registered for use by the Environmental Protection Agency(US EPA).  Today, Gypchek is produced in live gypsy moth caterpillarsin the laboratory by the USDA Forest Service and Animal and PlantHealth Inspection Service (APHIS), processed, and made availablefor aerial and ground application as part of the Federal and StateCooperative Suppression Program.<P><A NAME="fungus"><B><U>Fungus</U></B><P>In 1908, pest managers in the Boston area introduced the fungus<U>Entomophaga</U> <U>maimaiga</U> via infected gypsy moth larvaecollected in Japan.  Releases continued until 1911, when the localgypsy moth populations collapsed and there was no way to continuepropagating the fungus.  In June and July 1989, <U>E.</U> <U>maimaiga</U>was first recovered in North American gypsy moth and was foundcausing extensive epizootics in populations of gypsy moth in sevencontiguous northeastern States (Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont,New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania).  By 1990,the fungus was also recovered in three more northeastern states(Maine, Delaware, Maryland) and in southern Ontario.  Today <U>E.</U><U>maimaiga</U> occurs in most areas where the gypsy moth occursand is prevalent in low-to-high density gypsy moth populations,causing up to 95% mortality of large caterpillar (Figure 5). The fungus is highly variable, and as yet unpredictable, in reducinggypsy moth populations.  It is not applied as a direct control. Fungal resting spores in soil and infected gypsy moth cadaversare collected and dispersed by hand to spread the fungus to newlocations although natural spread has been fairly rapid (Reardonand Hajek 1993). <P>Parasites -- Using parasites against the gypsy moth has been oneof the most massive programs in biological control history (Reardon1981).<P><A NAME="0580"><B><U>1905 to 1980</U></B><P>From 1905 to 1980, approximately 78 species of parasites (over200,000 individuals) were sent to the USDA  Agricultural ResearchService (ARS) quarantine facilities in the United States.  Ofthese, approximately 53 species were shipped to cooperating agenciesfor initiation of laboratory colonies or release.  Between 1905and 1914, gypsy moth caterpillars and pupae containing parasiteswere collected in Europe, Japan, and Russia and shipped to theUnited States.  Six of the parasite species imported and introducedbecame established (Table 1).  Parasite importation was reinstatedin 1922 to 1933 with searching for gypsy moth infestations inFrance, Spain, Italy, Germany and Japan.  These efforts led tothe establishment of two flies and the possible establishmentof one wasp (Table 1).  <P>During both periods of foreign exploration, 1905-1914 and 1922-1933,hosts and parasites were collected from high-density gypsy mothpopulations.  Limited foreign exploration was resumed in the 1960's,and in the 1970's ARS established gypsy moth projects at theirEuropean Parasite Laboratory in France and Asian Parasite Laboratoryin Japan.  Only one exotic species of parasite was establishedduring this period probably due to numerous problems associatedwith rearing and releasing parasites.  Problems with rearing includeinadequate taxonomic identification and poor and variable hostquality and quantity.  Problems with releasing parasites includeinadequate numbers, &quot;laboratory&quot; strains that were notadaptable to field conditions, lack of alternate or overwinteringhosts, and lack of host density and habitat requirements.  Oneexotic species of parasite was released in the late 1960's and1970's but was not recovered until 1996.  Several parasites nativeto the United States have became opportunistic parasites of thegypsy moth, that is, when gypsy moths are available.  The augmentationapproach either as inundative releases (released individuals regulate)or inoculative releases (progeny of released parasites regulategenerations of the gypsy moth) has been attempted with numerousspecies against artificial and natural gypsy moth populations. In general the incidence of parasitism by the released speciesincreased, but no impact on gypsy moth populations was detected. Also, combinations of natural enemies (e.g. aerial applicationof the bacterial insecticide <U>Bt</U> and releases of <U>Cotesia</U><U>melanoscela</U>, to transmit NPV) have been used with limitedsuccess.  <P><A NAME="8092"><B><U>1980 to 1992</U></B><P>Prospects for using classical, and augmentation approaches toimprove biological control of the gypsy moth were explored againduring the 1980's and early 1990's.  Foreign exploration for parasitesshifted to Asia, and 17 parasite species were received at ARSquarantine in the United States.  Most of these were from Korea,Japan, and India (parasites of Indian gypsy moth, <U>Lymantria</U><U>obfuscata </U>Walker), whereas little material was obtainedfrom the other promising regions, China and the Russian Far East. Releases of 15 species were made, but establishment of only onespecies, the pupal parasite <U>Coccygomimus</U> <U>disparis</U>(Viereck) was confirmed.  This species appears to be dispersingwell over the generally infested area, but with limited effectivenessagainst the gypsy moth because it parasitizes numerous species.<P><A NAME="9397"><B><U>1993 to 1997</U></B><P>Recent interest in the classical approach to biological controlhas been provided through the National Biological Control Institute(USDA APHIS) and &quot;New Directions in Biological Control ofthe Gypsy Moth&quot; with efforts focusing in non-outbreak siteson promising species that have not been previously introduced. Dominant species from southern Europe that failed to become establishedin New England or the Middle Atlantic States (e.g., <U>Glyptapanteles</U><U>porthetriae</U> (Muesebeck)) are being imported and rearedfor release in the southern states with different forest habitattypes, climate, and availability of alternate host species (Fuester1993).  Manipulative experiments conducted in New England suggestthat artificial elevation of gypsy moth populations might be usefulfor maintaining populations of insects that parasitize caterpillars,such as <U>Compsilura</U> <U>concinnata</U> (Meigen), <U>Parasetigena</U><U>silvestris</U> (Robineau-Desvoidy), and <U>Cotesia</U> <U>melanoscela</U>(Ratzeburg). <P>Predators -- Many species of animals in the United States eatthe gypsy moth and other defoliating insects.  The gypsy mothpredator community is complex and includes about 50 species ofbirds and 20 species of mammals, along with some amphibians, reptiles,fish, insects, and spiders.  Only a few of these predators areknown to affect gypsy moth population dynamics. The predatorsare all opportunistic feeders, which means that their taste forthe gypsy moth depends upon the scarcity of other preferred foods. Vertebrate predators, especially the white-footed mouse (<U>Peromyscus</U><U>leucopus</U>), are major sources of large caterpillar and pupalmortality in low density gypsy moth populations.  Recent studiesof bird predation tend to show that gypsy moth is not a majorfood item of most species.<P>Insect predators especially ants and the imported carabid beetle<U>Calosoma</U> <U>sycophanta</U> (Figure 6) have a limited impacton gypsy moth populations.  <U>Calosoma</U> <U>sycophanta</U>was imported from Europe in 1905-1910 and became established easily. It is common throughout most of New England and extends intoNew York, New Jersey, central Pennsylvania, and northeast Maryland.The beetle is a specific predator of gypsy moth and usually associatedwith high density  gypsy moth populations.<P><A NAME="conclu"><B><U>Conclusions</U></B><P>In general, parasites together with other natural enemies (predatorsand pathogens) help regulate populations of the gypsy moth byreducing their numbers.   Whether these introduced parasites havereduced the average population density of the pest or lengthenedthe period between outbreaks is difficult to determine.  The rateof parasitism from a particular parasite species varies from siteto site and from year to year, depending on such factors as thenumber of gypsy moth larvae, the number of alternate hosts, andthe weather.  Eleven exotic species of parasites have been establishedand continue to disperse along with the gypsy moth.  Natural enemiesare thought to help maintain low density populations, but notto prevent the buildup of already increasing populations. Foreignexploration for natural enemies has occurred throughout most ofthe native range of the gypsy moth.  In the continued search forbiological control agents, selection of candidates focuses onspecies that are (1) from low density gypsy moth populations,(2) limited to one generation per year, (3) new or not previouslyreleased, and (4) found to preferentially attack female gypsymoth caterpillars or pupae.<P><A NAME="refer"><B><U>References</U></B><P>Fuester, R.  1993.
