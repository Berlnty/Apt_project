Little did                     this  group of onlookers know, but Kilby's invention, 7/16-by-1/16-inches                                         in size and called an integrated circuit, was about to revolutionize                      the electronics industry.                     <!--/TI-ABSTRACT-->                  </p>                  <h3 id="2">The Answer to a Problem</h3>                  <p>It was in a relatively deserted laboratory at TI's brand                     new Semiconductor Building where Jack Kilby first hit on the                     idea of the integrated circuit. In July 1958, when most employees                     left for the traditional <a href="/corp/docs/kilbyctr/vacation.shtml">two-week                     vacation</a> period, Kilby -- as a new employee with no vacation                     -- stayed to man the shop. </p>                  <p> What caused Kilby to think along the lines that eventually                     resulted in the integrated circuit? Like many inventors, he                     set out to solve a problem. In this case, the problem was                     called "the tyranny of numbers."                   <p> For almost 50 years after the turn of the 20th century,                     the electronics industry had been dominated by vacuum tube                     technology. But vacuum tubes had inherent limitations. They                     were fragile, bulky, unreliable, power hungry, and produced                     considerable heat.                   <p> It wasn't until 1947, with the invention of the transistor                     by Bell Telephone Laboratories, that the vacuum tube problem                     was solved. Transistors were miniscule in comparison, more                     reliable, longer lasting, produced less heat, and consumed                     less power. The transistor stimulated engineers to design                     ever more complex electronic circuits and equipment containing                     hundreds or thousands of discrete components such as transistors,                     diodes, rectifiers and capacitors. But the problem was that                     these components still had to be interconnected to form electronic                     circuits, and hand-soldering thousands of components to thousands                     of bits of wire was expensive and time-consuming. It was also                     unreliable; every soldered joint was a potential source of                     trouble. The challenge was to find cost-effective, reliable                     ways of producing these components and interconnecting them.                   <p> One stab at a solution was the Micro-Module program, sponsored                     by the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The idea was to make all the                     components a uniform size and shape, with the wiring built                     into the components. The modules then could be snapped together                     to make circuits, eliminating the need for wiring the connections.					<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>                   <h3 id="3">Enter Kilby</h3>                  <p><img src="/corp/docs/kilbyctr/graphics/kilbynotebook.jpg" alt="Jack St.Clair Kilby" width=125 height=190 hspace="8" vspace="2" border=0 align="left">TI                     was working on the Micro-Module program when Kilby joined                     the company in 1958. Because of his work with Centralab in                     Milwaukee, Kilby was familiar with the "tyranny of numbers"                     problem facing the industry. But he didn't think the Micro-Module                     was the answer &#151; it didn't address the basic problem                     of large quantities of components in elaborate circuits.<br>                    <br>                    So Kilby began searching for an alternative, and in the process                     decided the only thing a semiconductor house could make cost                     effectively was a semiconductor. "Further thought led me to                     the conclusion that semiconductors were all that were really                     required &#151; that resistors and capacitors [passive devices],                     in particular, could be made from the same material as the                     active devices [transistors]. I also realized that, since                     all of the components could be made of a single material,                     they could also be made in situ interconnected to form a complete                     circuit," Kilby wrote in a 1976 article titled "Invention                     of the IC."                   <p> Kilby began to write down and sketch out his ideas in July                     of 1958. By September, he was ready to demonstrate a working                     integrated circuit built on a piece of semiconductor material.                     Several executives, including former TI Chairman Mark Shepherd,                     gathered for the event on September 12, 1958. What they saw                     was a sliver of germanium, with protruding wires, glued to                     a glass slide. It was a rough device, but when Kilby pressed                     the switch, an unending sine curve undulated across the oscilloscope                     screen. His invention worked &#151; he had solved the problem.                   <p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>				  <h3 id="4">Early Successes</h3>                  <p>Kilby had made a big breakthrough. But while the U.S. Air                     Force showed some interest in TI's integrated circuit, industry                     reacted skeptically. Indeed the IC and its relative merits                     "provided much of the entertainment at major technical meetings                     over the next few years," Kilby wrote.                   <p> <img src="/corp/docs/kilbyctr/graphics/kilbywcalc.jpg" width=125 height=119 hspace=8 vspace=2 border=0 align="right" alt="Kilby with Calculator">The                     integrated circuit first won a place in the military market                     through programs such as the first computer using silicon                     chips for the Air Force in 1961 and the Minuteman Missile                     in 1962. Recognizing the need for a "demonstration product"                     to speed widespread use of the IC, Patrick E. Haggerty, former                     TI chairman, challenged Kilby to design a calculator as powerful                     as the large, electro-mechanical desktop models of the day,                     but small enough to fit in a coat pocket. The resulting electronic                     hand-held calculator, of which Kilby is a co-inventor, successfully                     commercialized the integrated circuit.</p>                  <p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>				  <h3 id="5">Impact</h3>                  <p>The impact of Kilby's tiny chip has been far-reaching. Many                     of the electronics products of today could not have been developed                     without it. The chip virtually created the modern computer                     industry, transforming yesterday's room-size machines into                     today's array of mainframes, minicomputers and personal computers.                   </p>                  <p> The chip restructured communications, fostering a host of                     new ways for instant exchanges of information between people,                     businesses and nations.                  <ul>                    <li>Without the chip, man could not explore space or fly to                       the moon.                     <li>The chip helps the deaf to hear and is the heartbeat of                       a myriad of medical diagnostic machines. </li>                    <li>The chip has also touched education, transportation, manufacturing                       and entertainment.                   </ul>                                  <p> For Texas Instruments, the integrated circuit has played a                   pivotal role. Over the years, the company has produced billions                   of chips. But the integrated circuit has done more than help                   grow TI. It has enabled an entire industry to grow. Since 1961,                   the worldwide electronics market has grown from $29 billion                   to nearly $1,500 billion.                <p> This growth will depend on the continued development of newer                   and better technologies -- like those being developed at Texas                   Instruments.                <p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>				  <h3 id="6">Toward the Future</h3>                  <p><img src="/corp/docs/kilbyctr/graphics/wafer2.jpg" width=182 height=129 hspace=8 vspace=2 border=0 align="right" alt="Wafer">With                     continuing advances in semiconductors, you can look forward                     to more new amazing encounters with electronic equipment.

Imaging turning on the oven from your car phone as you pull                     out of the parking lot at the end of the day. When you get                     home, dinner will be nearly done. Imagine setting your car                     on autopilot, and looking over notes for your next day's meeting                     on your commute home. Imagine you want to see a movie.
