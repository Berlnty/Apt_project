be described with deceptive simplicity as “an apparatus that performs routine calculations automatically.” Such a definition would owe its deceptiveness to a naive and narrow view of calculation as a strictly mathematical process. In fact, calculation underlies many activities that are not normally thought of as mathematical. Walking across a room, for instance, requires many complex, <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/albeit" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="albeit">albeit</a> subconscious, calculations. Computers, too, have proved capable of solving a vast array of problems, from balancing a checkbook to even—in the form of guidance systems for robots—walking across a room.</p><!--[P1]--><p>Before the true <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/power-physics" class="md-crosslink autoxref">power</a> of computing could be realized, therefore, the naive view of calculation had to be overcome. The inventors who laboured to bring the computer into the world had to learn that the thing they were inventing was not just a number cruncher, not merely a calculator. For example, they had to learn that it was not necessary to invent a new computer for every new calculation and that a computer could be designed to solve numerous problems, even problems not yet imagined when the computer was built. They also had to learn how to tell such a general problem-solving computer what problem to solve. In other words, they had to invent programming.</p><!--[P2]--><p>They had to solve all the heady problems of developing such a device, of <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/implementing" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="implementing">implementing</a> the design, of actually building the thing. The history of the solving of these problems is the history of the computer.

It dates back at least to 1100 <span class="text-smallcaps">bce</span> and is still in use today, particularly in Asia. Now, as then, it typically consists of a rectangular frame with thin parallel rods strung with beads. Long before any systematic positional notation was adopted for the writing of numbers, the abacus assigned different units, or weights, to each rod. This scheme allowed a wide range of numbers to be represented by just a few beads and, together with the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/invention-technology" class="md-crosslink autoxref">invention</a> of zero in India, may have inspired the invention of the Hindu-Arabic <span id="ref723576"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/numeral" class="md-crosslink">number system</a>. In any case, abacus beads can be readily manipulated to perform the common arithmetical operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—that are useful for commercial transactions and in bookkeeping.</p><!--[P4]--><p>The abacus is a digital device; that is, it represents values discretely.

As any person can attest, adding two 10-digit numbers is much simpler than multiplying them together, and the transformation of a multiplication problem into an addition problem is exactly what logarithms enable. This simplification is possible because of the following logarithmic property: the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/logarithm" class="md-crosslink autoxref">logarithm</a> of the product of two numbers is equal to the sum of the logarithms of the numbers. By 1624, tables with 14 significant digits were available for the logarithms of numbers from 1 to 20,000, and scientists quickly adopted the new labour-saving <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/tool" class="md-crosslink autoxref">tool</a> for tedious astronomical calculations.</p><!--[P6]--><p>Most significant for the development of computing, the transformation of multiplication into addition greatly simplified the possibility of mechanization. <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Analog" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="Analog">Analog</a> calculating devices based on Napier’s logarithms—representing digital values with <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/analogous" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="analogous">analogous</a> physical lengths—soon appeared. In 1620 <span id="ref723579"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edmund-Gunter" class="md-crosslink">Edmund Gunter</a>, the English mathematician who coined the terms <em>cosine</em> and <em>cotangent</em>, built a device for performing navigational calculations: the Gunter scale, or, as navigators simply called it, the gunter. About 1632 an English clergyman and mathematician named <span id="ref723580"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Oughtred" class="md-crosslink">William Oughtred</a> built the first <span id="ref723581"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/slide-rule" class="md-crosslink">slide rule</a>, drawing on Napier’s ideas. That first slide rule was circular, but Oughtred also built the first rectangular one in 1633. The analog devices of Gunter and Oughtred had various advantages and disadvantages compared with digital devices such as the abacus. What is important is that the consequences of these design decisions were being tested in the real world.</p><!--[P7]--></section><span id="ref216019" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref216023" data-level="4"><h2 class="h4">Digital calculators: from the Calculating Clock to the Arithmometer</h2><p>In 1623 the German astronomer and mathematician <span id="ref723582"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Wilhelm-Schickard" class="md-crosslink">Wilhelm Schickard</a> built the first <span id="ref723583"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/calculator" class="md-crosslink">calculator</a>.

Binary numbers are ideal for machines because they require only two digits, which can easily be represented by the on and off states of a switch. When computers became electronic, the binary system was particularly appropriate because an electrical circuit is either on or off. This meant that on could represent true, off could represent false, and the flow of current would directly represent the flow of logic.</p><!--[P12]--><p>Leibniz was prescient in seeing the appropriateness of the binary system in calculating machines, but his machine did not use it. Instead, the Step Reckoner represented numbers in decimal form, as positions on 10-position dials. Even decimal representation was not a given: in 1668 Samuel Morland invented an adding machine specialized for British money—a decidedly nondecimal system.</p><!--[P13]--><p>Pascal’s, Leibniz’s, and Morland’s devices were curiosities, but with the <span id="ref723591"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Industrial-Revolution" class="md-crosslink">Industrial Revolution</a> of the 18th century came a widespread need to perform repetitive operations efficiently.

Many other mechanical devices built during the 19th century also performed repetitive functions more or less automatically, but few had any application to computing. There was one major exception: the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Jacquard-loom" class="md-crosslink">Jacquard loom</a>, invented in 1804–05 by a French weaver, <span id="ref723595"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Marie-Jacquard" class="md-crosslink">Joseph-Marie Jacquard</a>.</p><!--[P15]--><p>The Jacquard loom was a marvel of the Industrial Revolution.

Once the cards had been punched and assembled, the design was complete, and the loom <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/implemented" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="implemented">implemented</a> the design automatically. The Jacquard loom, therefore, could be said to be programmed for different patterns by these decks of punched cards.</p><!--[P17]--><p>For those intent on mechanizing calculations, the Jacquard loom provided important lessons: the sequence of operations that a machine performs could be controlled to make the machine do something quite different; a punched card could be used as a medium for directing the machine; and, most important, a device could be directed to perform different tasks by feeding it instructions in a sort of language—i.e., making the machine programmable.</p><!--[P18]--><p>It is not too great a stretch to say that, in the Jacquard loom, programming was invented before the computer.

(It won the Royal Society’s first Gold Medal in 1823.) Tables then in use often contained errors, which could be a life-and-death matter for sailors at sea, and Babbage argued that, by automating the production of the tables, he could assure their accuracy. Having gained support in the society for his Difference Engine, as he called it, Babbage next turned to the British government to fund development, obtaining one of the world’s first government grants for research and technological development.</p><!--[P22]--><p>Babbage approached the project very seriously: he hired a master machinist, set up a fireproof workshop, and built a dustproof <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environment" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="environment">environment</a> for testing the device. Up until then calculations were rarely carried out to more than 6 digits; Babbage planned to produce 20- or 30-digit results routinely. The Difference Engine was a digital device: it operated on discrete digits rather than smooth quantities, and the digits were decimal (0–9), represented by positions on toothed wheels, rather than the binary digits that Leibniz favoured (but did not use). When one of the toothed wheels turned from 9 to 0, it caused the next <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/wheel" class="md-crosslink autoxref">wheel</a> to advance one position, carrying the digit just as Leibniz’s Step Reckoner calculator had operated.</p><!--[P23]--><p>The Difference Engine was more than a simple calculator, however. It mechanized not just a single calculation but a whole series of calculations on a number of variables to solve a complex problem. It went far beyond calculators in other ways as well. Like modern computers, the Difference Engine had storage—that is, a place where data could be held temporarily for later processing—and it was designed to stamp its output into soft metal, which could later be used to produce a printing plate.</p><!--[P24]--><p>Nevertheless, the Difference Engine performed only one operation. The operator would set up all of its data registers with the original data, and then the single operation would be repeatedly applied to all of the registers, ultimately producing a solution. Still, in complexity and <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/audacity" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="audacity">audacity</a> of design, it dwarfed any calculating device then in existence.</p><!--[P25]--><p>The full engine, designed to be room-size, was never built, at least not by Babbage. Although he sporadically received several government grants—governments changed, funding often ran out, and he had to personally bear some of the financial costs—he was working at or near the tolerances of the construction methods of the day, and he ran into numerous construction difficulties. All design and construction ceased in 1833, when <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Clement" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Joseph Clement</a>, the machinist responsible for actually building the machine, refused to continue unless he was prepaid. (The completed portion of the Difference Engine is on permanent exhibition at the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Science-Museum-London" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Science Museum</a> in London.)</p><!--[P26]--></section><span id="ref216019" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref216027" data-level="4"><h2 class="h4">The <span id="ref723601"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Analytical-Engine" class="md-crosslink">Analytical Engine</a></h2><p>While working on the Difference Engine, <span id="ref723602"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Babbage" class="md-crosslink">Babbage</a> began to imagine ways to improve it. Chiefly he thought about generalizing its operation so that it could perform other kinds of calculations. By the time the funding had run out in 1833, he had conceived of something far more revolutionary: a general-purpose computing machine called the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Analytical" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="Analytical">Analytical</a> Engine.</p><!--[P27]--><div class="assemblies"><figure data-type="image" class="md-assembly  media-overlay-link print-false" data-assembly-id="218452"><div class="md-assembly-wrapper" data-type="image"><div class="image-wrapper mg"><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/700x450/31/172531-004-964FE438.jpg" big-src="https://cdn.britannica.com/31/172531-004-964FE438.jpg" alt="Babbage, Charles: Analytical Engine" data-width="541" data-height="450"></div></div><figcaption><strong class="md-assembly-title">Babbage, Charles: Analytical Engine</strong><span class="md-assembly-caption">A portion (completed 1910) of Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.

It would be able to perform any calculation set before it. Before Babbage there is no evidence that anyone had ever conceived of such a device, let alone attempted to build one. The machine was designed to consist of four components: the mill, the store, the reader, and the printer. These components are the essential components of every computer today. The mill was the calculating unit, analogous to the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/central-processing-unit" class="md-crosslink autoxref">central processing unit</a> (CPU) in a modern computer; the store was where data were held prior to processing, exactly analogous to memory and storage in today’s computers; and the reader and printer were the input and output devices.</p><!--[P28]--><p>As with the Difference Engine, the project was far more complex than anything theretofore built. The store was to be large enough to hold 1,000 50-digit numbers; this was larger than the storage capacity of any computer built before 1960. The machine was to be steam-driven and run by one attendant. The printing capability was also ambitious, as it had been for the Difference Engine: Babbage wanted to automate the process as much as possible, right up to producing printed tables of numbers.</p><!--[P29]--><p>The reader was another new feature of the Analytical Engine. Data (numbers) were to be entered on <span id="ref723603"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/punched-card" class="md-crosslink">punched cards</a>, using the card-reading technology of the Jacquard loom. Instructions were also to be entered on cards, another idea taken directly from Jacquard. The use of instruction cards would make it a programmable device and far more flexible than any machine then in existence. Another element of programmability was to be its ability to execute instructions in other than sequential order. It was to have a kind of decision-making ability in its conditional control transfer, also known as <span id="ref723604"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/conditional-branching" class="md-crosslink">conditional branching</a>, whereby it would be able to jump to a different instruction depending on the value of some data. This extremely powerful feature was missing in many of the early computers of the 20th century.</p><!--[P30]--><p>By most definitions, the Analytical Engine was a real computer as understood today—or would have been, had not Babbage run into implementation problems again. Actually building his ambitious design was judged infeasible given the current technology, and Babbage’s failure to generate the promised mathematical tables with his Difference Engine had dampened enthusiasm for further government funding. Indeed, it was apparent to the British government that Babbage was more interested in <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/innovation" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="innovation">innovation</a> than in constructing tables.</p><!--[P31]--><p>All the same, Babbage’s Analytical Engine was something new under the sun. Its most revolutionary feature was the ability to change its operation by changing the instructions on punched cards. Until this breakthrough, all the mechanical aids to calculation were merely calculators or, like the Difference Engine, glorified calculators. The Analytical Engine, although not actually completed, was the first machine that deserved to be called a computer.</p><!--[P32]--></section><span id="ref216019" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref216028" data-level="4"><h2 class="h4">Lady Lovelace, the first programmer</h2><p>The distinction between calculator and computer, although clear to Babbage, was not apparent to most people in the early 19th century, even to the intellectually adventuresome visitors at Babbage’s soirees—with the exception of a young girl of unusual parentage and education.</p><!--[P33]--><div class="assemblies"><figure data-type="image" class="md-assembly  media-overlay-link print-false" data-assembly-id="218453"><div class="md-assembly-wrapper" data-type="image"><div class="image-wrapper mg"><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/700x450/31/187431-004-FBEAC545.jpg" big-src="https://cdn.britannica.com/31/187431-004-FBEAC545.jpg" alt="Lovelace, Ada" data-width="304" data-height="450"></div></div><figcaption><strong class="md-assembly-title">Lovelace, Ada</strong><span class="md-assembly-caption">Ada Lovelace.</span><cite>World History Archive/AGE fotostock</cite></figcaption></figure></div><!--[ML33]--><p><span id="ref723605"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ada-Lovelace" class="md-crosslink">Augusta Ada King, the countess of Lovelace</a>, was the daughter of the poet <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lord-Byron-poet" class="md-crosslink">Lord Byron</a> and the mathematically inclined Anne Millbanke.

Because Byron was involved in a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/notorious" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="notorious">notorious</a> scandal at the time of her birth, Ada’s mother encouraged her mathematical and scientific interests, hoping to suppress any inclination to wildness she may have inherited from her father.</p><!--[P34]--><p>Toward that end, Lady Lovelace attended Babbage’s <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soirees" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="soirees">soirees</a> and became fascinated with his Difference Engine. She also corresponded with him, asking pointed questions. It was his plan for the Analytical Engine that truly fired her imagination, however. In 1843, at age 27, she had come to understand it well enough to publish the definitive paper explaining the device and drawing the crucial distinction between this new thing and existing calculators. The Analytical Engine, she argued, went beyond the bounds of arithmetic. Because it operated on general symbols rather than on numbers, it established “a link…between the operations of matter and the abstract mental processes of the most abstract branch of mathematical science.” It was a physical device that was capable of operating in the realm of abstract thought.</p><!--[P35]--><p>Lady Lovelace rightly reported that this was not only something no one had built, it was something that no one before had even conceived. She went on to become the world’s only expert on the process of sequencing instructions on the punched cards that the Analytical Engine used; that is, she became the world’s first <span id="ref723606"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer-program" class="md-crosslink">computer programmer</a>.</p><!--[P36]--><p>One feature of the Analytical Engine was its ability to place numbers and instructions temporarily in its store and return them to its mill for processing at an appropriate time. This was accomplished by the proper sequencing of instructions and data in its reader, and the ability to reorder instructions and data gave the machine a flexibility and power that was hard to grasp. The first electronic digital computers of a century later lacked this ability. It was remarkable that a young scholar realized its importance in 1840, and it would be 100 years before anyone would understand it so well again. In the intervening century, attention would be diverted to the calculator and other business machines.</p><!--[P37]--></section></section><span id="ref216019" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref216029" data-level="3"><h2 class="h3">Early business machines</h2><p>Throughout the 19th century, business machines were coming into common use.

Nevertheless, he made it clear from the start that his results implied the possibility of building a machine of the sort he described. His work characterized the abstract essence of any computing device so well that it was in effect a challenge to actually build one.</p><!--[P55]--><p>Turing’s work had an immediate effect on only a small number of academics at a few universities who were interested in the concept of computing machinery. It had no immediate effect on the growing industry of business machines, all of which were special-purpose devices. But to the few who were interested, Turing’s work was an inspiration to pursue something of which most of the world had not even conceived: a universal computing machine.</p><!--[P56]--></section><span id="ref216032" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref216037" data-level="3"><h2 class="h3">Pioneering work</h2><span id="ref216032" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref216038" data-level="4"><h2 class="h4">The <span id="ref723621"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Atanasoff-Berry-Computer" class="md-crosslink">Atanasoff-Berry Computer</a></h2><p>It was generally believed that the first electronic <span id="ref724776"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/digital-computer" class="md-crosslink">digital computers</a> were the Colossus, built in England in 1943, and the ENIAC, built in the United States in 1945.

All of his prototype machines, built in 1936, used binary representation in order to simplify construction.

Like his Z3 (described in the section <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer/History-of-computing#ref216040" class="md-crosslink">Konrad Zuse</a>), the Z4 used electromechanical relays, in part because of the difficulty in acquiring the roughly 2,000 necessary vacuum tubes in wartime Germany. The Z4 was evacuated from Berlin in early 1945, and it eventually wound up in Hinterstein, a small village in the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Bavarian-Alps" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Bavarian Alps</a>, where it remained until Zuse brought it to the Federal Technical Institute in Zürich, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Switzerland" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Switzerland</a>, for refurbishing in 1950.

Designed for the specific purpose of computing values for artillery range tables, it lacked some features that would have made it a more generally useful machine. Like Colossus but unlike Howard Aiken’s machine (described in the section <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer/History-of-computing#ref216033" class="md-crosslink">Early experiments</a>), it used plugboards for communicating instructions to the machine; this had the advantage that, once the instructions were thus “programmed,” the machine ran at electronic speed. Instructions read from a card reader or other slow mechanical device would not have been able to keep up with the all-electronic ENIAC. The disadvantage was that it took days to rewire the machine for each new problem. This was such a liability that only with some generosity could it be called programmable.</p><!--[P73]--><p>Nevertheless, ENIAC was the most powerful calculating device built to date. Like Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine and the Colossus, but unlike Aiken’s Mark I, Konrad Zuse’s Z4, and George Stibitz’s telephone-savvy machine, it did have <span id="ref723660"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/conditional-branching" class="md-crosslink">conditional branching</a>—that is, it had the ability to execute different instructions or to alter the order of execution of instructions based on the value of some data. (For instance, IF X &gt; 5 THEN GO TO LINE 23.) This gave ENIAC a lot of flexibility and meant that, while it was built for a specific purpose, it could be used for a wider range of problems.</p><!--[P74]--><p>ENIAC was enormous. It occupied the 50-by-30-foot (15-by-9-metre) basement of the Moore School, where its 40 panels were arranged, U-shaped, along three walls. Each of the units was about 2 feet wide by 2 feet deep by 8 feet high (0.6 by 0.6 by 2.4 metres). With approximately 18,000 vacuum tubes, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors, 6,000 switches, and 1,500 relays, it was easily the most complex electronic system theretofore built. ENIAC ran continuously (in part to extend tube life), generating 150 kilowatts of heat, and could execute up to 5,000 additions per second, several orders of magnitude faster than its electromechanical predecessors. Colossus, ENAIC, and subsequent computers employing <span id="ref723661"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/electron-tube" class="md-crosslink">vacuum tubes</a> are known as <span id="ref723662"></span>first-generation computers. (With 1,500 mechanical relays, ENIAC was still transitional to later, fully electronic computers.)</p><!--[P75]--><p>Completed by February 1946, ENIAC had cost the government $400,000, and the war it was designed to help win was over. Its first task was doing calculations for the construction of a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/thermonuclear-bomb" class="md-crosslink autoxref">hydrogen bomb</a>.

The British work was largely focused on code breaking, the American work on computing projectile trajectories and calculations for the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/atomic-bomb" class="md-crosslink autoxref">atomic bomb</a>. The computers were built as special-purpose devices, although they often embodied more general-purpose computing capabilities than their specifications called for. The vacuum tubes in these machines were not entirely reliable, but with no moving parts they were more reliable than the electromechanical switches they replaced, and they were much faster. Reliability was an issue, since Colossus used some 1,500 tubes and ENIAC on the order of 18,000. But ENIAC was, by virtue of its electronic realization, 1,000 times faster than the Harvard Mark I. Such speed meant that the machine could perform calculations that were theretofore beyond human ability. Although tubes were a great advance over the electromechanical realization of Aiken or the steam-and-mechanical model of Babbage, the basic <span id="ref723663"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer-architecture" class="md-crosslink">architecture</a> of the machines (that is, the functions they were able to perform) was not much advanced beyond Babbage’s Difference Engine and Analytical Engine. In fact, the original name for ENIAC was Electronic Difference Analyzer, and it was built to perform much like Babbage’s Difference Engine.</p><!--[P77]--><p>After the war, efforts focused on fulfilling the idea of a general-purpose computing device. In 1945, before ENIAC was even finished, planning began at the Moore School for ENIAC’s successor, the <span id="ref723664"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Electronic-Discrete-Variable-Automatic-Computer" class="md-crosslink">Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer</a>, or EDVAC. (Planning for EDVAC also set the stage for an ensuing patent fight; <em>see</em> <span href="6" class="md-link additional-content-link">BTW: Computer patent wars</span>.) ENIAC was hampered, as all previous electronic computers had been, by the need to use one <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/electron-tube" class="md-crosslink autoxref">vacuum tube</a> to store each <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/bit-communications" class="md-crosslink autoxref">bit</a>, or binary digit.

For EDVAC, Eckert had a new idea for <span id="ref723670"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/storage-computing" class="md-crosslink">storage</a>.</p><!--[P78]--><p>In 1880 French physicists Pierre and Jacques Curie had discovered that applying an <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/electric-current" class="md-crosslink autoxref">electric current</a> to a quartz crystal would produce a characteristic vibration and vice versa. During the 1930s at Bell Laboratories, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Shockley" class="md-crosslink">William Shockley</a>, later coinventor of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/transistor" class="md-crosslink">transistor</a>, had demonstrated a device—a tube, called a <span id="ref723672"></span>delay line, containing water and ethylene glycol—for effecting a predictable delay in information <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/transmission-engineering" class="md-crosslink autoxref">transmission</a>. Eckert had already built and experimented in 1943 with such a delay line (using mercury) in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/conjunction-logic" class="md-crosslink autoxref">conjunction</a> with <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/radar" class="md-crosslink autoxref">radar</a> research, and sometime in 1944 he hit upon the new idea of placing a quartz crystal at each end of the mercury delay line in order to sustain and modify the resulting pattern. In effect, he invented a new storage device. Whereas ENIAC required one tube per bit, EDVAC could use a delay line and 10 vacuum tubes to store 1,000 bits. Before the invention of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/magnetic-core-storage" class="md-crosslink autoxref">magnetic core memory</a> and the transistor, which would eliminate the need for vacuum tubes altogether, the mercury delay line was instrumental in increasing computer storage and reliability.</p><!--[P79]--></section><span id="ref216032" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref216047" data-level="4"><h2 class="h4">Von Neumann’s “Preliminary Discussion”</h2><p>But the design of the modern, or classical, computer did not fully crystallize until the publication of a 1946 paper by Arthur Burks, <span id="ref724921"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Herman-Goldstine" class="md-crosslink">Herman Goldstine</a>, and <span id="ref723673"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-von-Neumann" class="md-crosslink">John von Neumann</a> titled “<span id="ref723674"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Preliminary-Discussion-of-the-Logical-Design-of-an-Electronic-Computing-Instrument" class="md-crosslink">Preliminary Discussion of the Logical Design of an Electronic Computing Instrument</a>”. Although the paper was essentially a synthesis of ideas currently “in the air,” it is frequently cited as the birth certificate of computer science.</p><!--[P80]--><p>Among the principles enunciated in the paper were that data and instructions should be kept in a single <span id="ref723675"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/stored-program-concept" class="md-crosslink">store</a> and that instructions should be encoded so as to be modifiable by other instructions. This was an extremely critical decision, because it meant that one program could be treated as data by another program. Zuse had considered and rejected this possibility as too dangerous. But its inclusion by von Neumann’s group made possible high-level programming languages and most of the advances in software of the following 50 years. Subsequently, computers with stored programs would be known as von Neumann machines.</p><!--[P81]--><p>One problem that the stored-program idea solved was the need for rapid access to instructions. Colossus and ENIAC had used plugboards, which had the advantage of enabling the instructions to be read in electronically, rather than by much slower mechanical card readers, but it also had the disadvantage of making these first-generation machines very hard to program. But if the instructions could be stored in the same electronic memory that held the data, they could be accessed as quickly as needed.

A magnetic drum was added to provide a random-access secondary storage device.

The partners delivered the first UNIVAC to the U.S. Bureau of the Census in March 1951, although their company, their patents, and their talents had been acquired by Remington Rand, Inc., in 1950. Although it owed something to experience with ENIAC, UNIVAC was built from the start as a stored-program computer, so it was really different architecturally. It used an operator keyboard and console typewriter for input and magnetic tape for all other input and output. Printed output was recorded on tape and then printed by a separate tape printer.</p><!--[P88]--><p>The UNIVAC I was designed as a commercial data-processing computer, intended to replace the punched-card accounting machines of the day. It could read 7,200 decimal digits per second (it did not use binary numbers), making it by far the fastest business machine yet built. Its use of Eckert’s mercury delay lines greatly reduced the number of vacuum tubes needed (to 5,000), thus enabling the main processor to occupy a “mere” 14.5 by 7.5 by 9 feet (approximately 4.4 by 2.3 by 2.7 metres) of space. It was a true business machine, signaling the convergence of academic computational research with the office <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/automation" class="md-crosslink autoxref">automation</a> trend of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Several computer-building projects had been launched immediately after the end of World War II in 1945, primarily in the United States and Britain. These projects were inspired chiefly by a 1946 document, “<span id="ref723692"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Preliminary-Discussion-of-the-Logical-Design-of-an-Electronic-Computing-Instrument" class="md-crosslink">Preliminary Discussion of the Logical Design of an Electronic Digital Computing Instrument</a>,” produced by a group working under the direction of mathematician <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-von-Neumann" class="md-crosslink">John von Neumann</a> of the <span id="ref723693"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Institute-for-Advanced-Study" class="md-crosslink">Institute for Advanced Study</a> at <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Princeton-University" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Princeton University</a>. The IAS paper, as von Neumann’s document became known, articulated the concept of the stored program—a concept that has been called the single largest innovation in the history of the computer. (Von Neumann’s principles are described earlier, in the section <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer/History-of-computing#ref216045" class="md-crosslink">Toward the classical computer</a>.) Most computers built in the years following the paper’s distribution were designed according to its plan, yet by 1950 there were still only a handful of working stored-program computers.</p><!--[P90]--><div class="assemblies"><figure data-type="image" class="md-assembly  media-overlay-link print-false" data-assembly-id="19213"><div class="md-assembly-wrapper" data-type="image"><div class="image-wrapper mg"><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/700x450/01/23601-004-CD74EAC4.jpg" big-src="https://cdn.britannica.com/01/23601-004-CD74EAC4.jpg" alt="An IBM 650 computer system, c. 1954Relatively inexpensive, compact, and easy to operate, the IBM 650 quickly became the most widely used computer for business applications." data-width="379" data-height="300"></div></div><figcaption><span class="md-assembly-caption">An IBM 650 computer system, c. 1954Relatively inexpensive, compact, and easy to operate, the IBM 650 quickly became the most widely used computer for business applications.</span><cite>IBM Archives</cite></figcaption></figure></div><!--[ML90]--><p>Business use at this time was marginal because the machines were so hard to use. Although computer makers such as Remington Rand, the Burroughs Adding Machine Company, and <span id="ref723695"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/International-Business-Machines-Corporation" class="md-crosslink">IBM</a> had begun building machines to the IAS specifications, it was not until 1954 that a real market for business computers began to emerge. The <span id="ref723694"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/IBM-650" class="md-crosslink">IBM 650</a>, delivered at the end of 1954 for colleges and businesses, was a decimal implementation of the IAS design. With this low-cost magnetic drum computer, which sold for about $200,000 apiece (compared with about $1,000,000 for the scientific model, the IBM 701), IBM had a hit, eventually selling about 1,800 of them. In addition, by offering universities that taught computer science courses around the IBM 650 an academic discount program (with price reductions of up to 60 percent), IBM established a cadre of engineers and programmers for their machines. (Apple later used a similar discount strategy in American grade schools to capture a large proportion of the early microcomputer market.)</p><!--[P91]--><p>A snapshot of the era would also have to show what could be called the sociology of computing. The actual use of computers was restricted to a small group of trained experts, and there was resistance to the idea that this group should be expanded by making the machines easier to use. Machine time was expensive, more expensive than the time of the mathematicians and scientists who needed to use the machines, and computers could process only one problem at a time. As a result, the machines were in a sense held in higher regard than the scientists. If a task could be done by a person, it was thought that the machine’s time should not be wasted with it. The public’s perception of computers was not positive either. If motion pictures of the time can be used as a guide, the popular image was of a room-filling brain attended by white-coated technicians, mysterious and somewhat frightening—about to eliminate jobs through automation.</p><!--[P92]--><p>Yet the machines of the early 1950s were not much more capable than Charles Babbage’s <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer/History-of-computing#ref216027" class="md-crosslink">Analytical Engine</a> of the 1830s (although they were much faster). Although in principle these were general-purpose computers, they were still largely restricted to doing tough math problems. They often lacked the means to perform logical operations, and they had little text-handling capability—for example, lowercase letters were not even representable in the machines, even if there were devices capable of printing them.</p><!--[P93]--><p>These machines could be operated only by experts, and preparing a problem for computation (what would be called programming today) took a long time. With only one person at a time able to use a machine, major bottlenecks were created. Problems lined up like experiments waiting for a cyclotron or the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/space-shuttle" class="md-crosslink autoxref">space shuttle</a>. Much of the machine’s <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/precious" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="precious">precious</a> time was wasted because of this one-at-a-time <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/protocol" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="protocol">protocol</a>.</p><!--[P94]--><p>In sum, the machines were expensive and the market was still small. To be useful in a broader business market or even in a broader scientific market, computers would need application programs: word processors, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/database" class="md-crosslink autoxref">database</a> programs, and so on. These applications in turn would require programming languages in which to write them and operating systems to manage them.</p><!--[P95]--><span id="ref216051" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref216052" data-level="3"><h2 class="h3"><span id="ref723696"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer-programming-language" class="md-crosslink">Programming languages</a></h2><span id="ref216051" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref216053" data-level="4"><h2 class="h4">Early computer language development</h2><span id="ref216051" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref216054" data-level="5"><h2 class="h5"><span id="ref723697"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/machine-language" class="md-crosslink">Machine language</a></h2><p>One <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/implication" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="implication">implication</a> of the stored-program model was that programs could read and operate on other programs as data; that is, they would be capable of <span id="ref723699"></span>self-modification. <span id="ref723698"></span>Konrad Zuse had looked upon this possibility as “making a contract with the Devil” because of the potential for abuse, and he had chosen not to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/implement" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="implement">implement</a> it in his machines. But self-modification was essential for achieving a true general-purpose machine.</p><!--[P96]--><p>One of the very first employments of self-modification was for computer language <span id="ref723702"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/translator-computing" class="md-crosslink">translation</a>, “language” here referring to the instructions that make the machine work. Although the earliest machines worked by flipping switches, the stored-program machines were driven by stored coded instructions, and the conventions for encoding these instructions were referred to as the machine’s language.</p><!--[P97]--><p>Writing programs for early computers meant using the machine’s language. The form of a particular machine’s language is dictated by its physical and logical structure. For example, if the machine uses registers to store intermediate results of calculations, there must be instructions for moving data between such registers.</p><!--[P98]--><p>The vocabulary and rules of <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/syntax" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="syntax">syntax</a> of machine language tend to be highly detailed and very far from the natural or mathematical language in which problems are normally formulated. The desirability of automating the translation of problems into machine language was immediately evident to users, who either had to become computer experts and programmers themselves in order to use the machines or had to rely on experts and programmers who might not fully understand the problems they were translating.</p><!--[P99]--><p>Automatic translation from pure mathematics or some other “<span id="ref723700"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/high-level-language" class="md-crosslink">high-level language</a>” to machine language was therefore necessary before computers would be useful to a broader class of users. As early as the 1830s, Charles Babbage and Lady Lovelace had recognized that such translation could be done by machine (<em>see</em> the earlier section <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer/History-of-computing#ref216028" class="md-crosslink">Lady Lovelace, the first programmer</a>), but they made no attempt to follow up on this idea and simply wrote their programs in machine language.</p><!--[P100]--><p><span id="ref723701"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Howard-Aiken" class="md-crosslink">Howard Aiken</a>, working in the 1930s, also saw the virtue of automated translation from a high-level language to machine language. Aiken proposed a coding machine that would be dedicated to this task, accepting high-level programs and producing the actual machine-language instructions that the computer would process.</p><!--[P101]--><p>But a separate machine was not actually necessary. The IAS model guaranteed that the stored-program computer would have the power to serve as its own coding machine. The translator program, written in machine language and running on the computer, would be fed the target program as data, and it would output machine-language instructions. This plan was altogether feasible, but the cost of the machines was so great that it was not seen as cost-effective to use them for anything that a human could do—including program translation.</p><!--[P102]--><p>Two forces, in fact, argued against the early development of high-level computer languages. One was <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/skepticism" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="skepticism">skepticism</a> that anyone outside the “priesthood” of computer operators could or would use computers directly. Consequently, early computer makers saw no need to make them more accessible to people who would not use them anyway. A second reason was <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/efficiency" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="efficiency">efficiency</a>. Any translation process would necessarily add to the computing time necessary to solve a problem, and mathematicians and operators were far cheaper by the hour than computers.</p><!--[P103]--><p>Programmers did, though, come up with specialized high-level languages, or HLLs, for computer instruction—even without automatic translators to turn their programs into machine language. They simply did the translation by hand. They did this because casting problems in an intermediate programming language, somewhere between mathematics and the highly detailed language of the machine, had the advantage of making it easier to understand the program’s logical structure and to correct, or debug, any defects in the program.</p><!--[P104]--><p>The early HLLs thus were all paper-and-pencil methods of recasting problems in an intermediate form that made it easier to write code for a machine. <span id="ref724922"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Herman-Goldstine" class="md-crosslink">Herman Goldstine</a>, with contributions from his wife, Adele Goldstine, and from John von Neumann, created a graphical representation of this process: flow diagrams.

Zuse’s language allowed for the creation of procedures (also called routines or subroutines; stored chunks of code that could be <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/invoked" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="invoked">invoked</a> repeatedly to perform routine operations such as taking a square root) and structured data (such as a record in a database, with a mixture of alphabetic and numeric data representing, for instance, name, address, and birth date). In addition, it provided conditional statements that could modify program execution, as well as repeat, or loop, statements that would cause a marked block of statements or a subroutine to be repeated a specified number of times or for as long as some condition held.</p><!--[P106]--><p>Zuse knew that computers could do more than arithmetic, but he was aware of the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/propensity" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="propensity">propensity</a> of anyone introduced to them to view them as nothing more than calculators. So he took pains to demonstrate nonnumeric solutions with Plankalkül. He wrote programs to check the syntactical correctness of Boolean expressions (an application in logic and text handling) and even to check chess moves.</p><!--[P107]--><p>Unlike flowcharts, Zuse’s program was no intermediate language intended for pencil-and-paper translation by mathematicians. It was deliberately intended for machine translation, and Zuse did some work toward implementing a translator for Plankalkül. He did not get very far, however; he had to disassemble his machine near the end of the war and was not able to put it back together and work on it for several years. Unfortunately, his language and his work, which were roughly a dozen years ahead of their time, were not generally known outside Germany.</p><!--[P108]--></section><span id="ref216051" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref216056" data-level="5"><h2 class="h5"><span id="ref723716"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/interpreter" class="md-crosslink">Interpreters</a></h2><p>HLL coding was attempted right from the start of the stored-program era in the late 1940s. <span id="ref723735"></span>Shortcode, or short-order code, was the first such language actually implemented.

Shortcode went through multiple steps: first it converted the alphabetic statements of the language to numeric codes, and then it translated these numeric codes into machine language. It was an interpreter, meaning that it translated HLL statements and executed, or performed, them one at a time—a slow process. Because of their slow execution, interpreters are now rarely used outside of program development, where they may help a programmer to locate errors quickly.</p><!--[P109]--></section><span id="ref216051" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref216057" data-level="5"><h2 class="h5"><span id="ref723775"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/compiler" class="md-crosslink">Compilers</a></h2><p>An <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alternative" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="alternative">alternative</a> to this approach is what is now known as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/compiler" class="md-crosslink autoxref">compilation</a>.

Throughout the 1950s Hopper campaigned earnestly for high-level languages across the United States, and through her public appearances she helped to remove resistance to the idea. Such urging found a receptive audience at IBM, where the management wanted to add computers to the company’s successful line of business machines.</p><!--[P113]--></section><span id="ref216051" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref216060" data-level="5"><h2 class="h5"><span id="ref723896"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/International-Business-Machines-Corporation" class="md-crosslink">IBM</a> develops <span id="ref723895"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/FORTRAN" class="md-crosslink">FORTRAN</a></h2><p>In the early 1950s <span id="ref723915"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Warner-Backus" class="md-crosslink">John Backus</a> convinced his managers at IBM to let him put together a team to design a language and write a compiler for it. He had a machine in mind: the <span id="ref723935"></span>IBM 704, which had built-in floating-point math operations. That the 704 used floating-point representation made it especially useful for scientific work, and Backus believed that a scientifically oriented programming language would make the machine even more attractive. Still, he understood the resistance to anything that slowed a machine down, and he set out to produce a language and a compiler that would produce code that ran virtually as fast as hand-coded machine language—and at the same time made the program-writing process a lot easier.</p><!--[P114]--><p>By 1954 Backus and a team of programmers had designed the language, which they called FORTRAN (Formula Translation). Programs written in FORTRAN looked a lot more like mathematics than machine instructions:</p><!--[P115]--><blockquote><p>DO 10 J = 1,11</p><p>I = 11 − J</p><p>Y = F(A(I + 1))</p><p>IF (400 − Y) 4,8,8</p><p>4 PRINT 5,1</p><p>5 FORMAT (I10, 10H TOO LARGE)</p></blockquote><p>The compiler was written, and the language was released with a professional-looking typeset manual (a first for programming languages) in 1957.</p><!--[P122]--><p>FORTRAN took another step toward making programming more accessible, allowing comments in the programs. The ability to insert <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/annotations" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="annotations">annotations</a>, marked to be ignored by the translator program but readable by a human, meant that a well-annotated program could be read in a certain sense by people with no programming knowledge at all. For the first time a nonprogrammer could get an idea what a program did—or at least what it was intended to do—by reading (part of) the code. It was an obvious but powerful step in opening up computers to a wider audience.</p><!--[P123]--><p>FORTRAN has continued to evolve, and it retains a large user base in academia and among scientists.</p><!--[P124]--></section><span id="ref216051" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref216061" data-level="5"><h2 class="h5"><span id="ref723955"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/COBOL" class="md-crosslink">COBOL</a></h2><p>About the time that Backus and his team invented FORTRAN, Hopper’s group at UNIVAC released Math-matic, a FORTRAN-like language for UNIVAC computers.

One was high-level programming languages (as described in the preceding section, FORTRAN, COBOL, and ALGOL). The other was control. Today the systemwide control functions of a computer are generally subsumed under the term <em>operating system</em>, or OS. An OS handles the behind-the-scenes activities of a computer, such as orchestrating the transitions from one program to another and managing access to disk storage and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/input-output-device" class="md-crosslink autoxref">peripheral</a> devices.</p><!--[P134]--><p>The need for some kind of supervisor program was quickly recognized, but the design requirements for such a program were <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/daunting" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="daunting">daunting</a>. The supervisor program would have to run in parallel with an application program somehow, monitor its actions in some way, and seize control when necessary. Moreover, the essential—and difficult—feature of even a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rudimentary" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="rudimentary">rudimentary</a> supervisor program was the <span id="ref724095"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/interrupt-signal" class="md-crosslink">interrupt</a> facility.

But the company had been slow to implement the stored-program digital computer architecture of the early 1950s. It did develop the IBM 650, a (like UNIVAC) decimal implementation of the IAS plan—and the first computer to sell more than 1,000 units.</p><!--[P137]--><p>The invention of the <span id="ref724155"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/transistor" class="md-crosslink">transistor</a> in 1947 led IBM to reengineer its early machines from electromechanical or vacuum tube to transistor technology in the late 1950s (although the UNIVAC Model 80, delivered in 1958, was the first transistor computer). These transistorized machines are commonly referred to as <span id="ref724175"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/second-generation-computer" class="md-crosslink">second-generation computers.</a></p><!--[P138]--><p>Two IBM inventions, the magnetic disk and the high-speed chain printer, led to an expansion of the market and to the unprecedented sale of 12,000 computers of one model: the <span id="ref724195"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/IBM-1401" class="md-crosslink">IBM 1401</a>. The chain printer required a lot of magnetic core memory, and IBM engineers packaged the printer support, core memory, and disk support into the 1401, one of the first computers to use this solid-state technology.</p><!--[P139]--><p>IBM had several lines of computers developed by independent groups of engineers within the company: a scientific-technical line, a commercial data-processing line, an accounting line, a decimal machine line, and a line of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/supercomputer" class="md-crosslink">supercomputers</a>. Each line had a distinct hardware-dependent operating system, and each required separate development and maintenance of its associated application software. In the early 1960s IBM began designing a machine that would take the best of all these <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/disparate" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="disparate">disparate</a> lines, add some new technology and new ideas, and replace all the company’s computers with one single line, the 360. At an estimated development cost of $5 billion, IBM literally bet the company’s future on this new, untested architecture.</p><!--[P140]--><p>The 360 was in fact an architecture, not a single machine. Designers G.M. Amdahl, F.P. Brooks, and G.A. Blaauw explicitly separated the 360 architecture from its implementation details. The 360 architecture was intended to span a wide range of machine implementations and multiple generations of machines. The first 360 models were hybrid transistor–integrated circuit machines. <span id="ref724216"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/integrated-circuit" class="md-crosslink">Integrated circuit</a> computers are commonly referred to as <span id="ref724215"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/third-generation-computer" class="md-crosslink">third-generation computers</a>.</p><!--[P141]--><p>Key to the architecture was the operating system. OS/360 ran on all machines built to the 360 architecture—initially six machines spanning a wide range of performance characteristics and later many more machines. It had a shielded supervisory system (unlike the 1401, which could be interfered with by application programs), and it reserved certain operations as privileged in that they could be performed only by the supervisor program.</p><!--[P142]--><p>The first IBM 360 computers were delivered in 1965. The 360 architecture represented a continental divide in the relative importance of hardware and software. After the 360, computers were defined by their operating systems.</p><!--[P143]--><p>The market, on the other hand, was defined by IBM. In the late 1950s and into the 1960s, it was common to refer to the computer industry as “IBM and the Seven Dwarfs,” a reference to the relatively diminutive market share of its nearest rivals—Sperry Rand (UNIVAC), Control Data Corporation (CDC), Honeywell, Burroughs, General Electric (GE), RCA, and National Cash Register Co. During this time IBM had some 60–70 percent of all computer sales. The 360 did nothing to lessen the giant’s dominance. When the market did open up somewhat, it was not due to the efforts of, nor was it in favour of, the dwarfs. Yet, while “IBM and the Seven Dwarfs” (soon reduced to “IBM and the BUNCH of Five,” BUNCH being an <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acronym" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="acronym">acronym</a> for Burroughs, UNIVAC, NCR, CDC, and Honeywell) continued to build Big Iron, a fundamental change was taking place in how computers were accessed.</p><!--[P144]--><ul class="assemblies medialist" data-type="other"><li><figure data-type="video" class="md-assembly  media-overlay-link print-false" data-assembly-id="207544"><div class="md-assembly-wrapper" data-type="video"><div class="image-wrapper mg"><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/700x450/94/186694-049-E77CFC99.jpg" alt="Elliott 803 computer" data-width="426" data-height="240"></div></div><figcaption><strong class="md-assembly-title">Elliott 803 computer</strong><span class="md-assembly-caption">Learn about the Elliott 803, a transistorized computer made in the United Kingdom in the early 1960s.</span><cite>© Open University</cite></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure data-type="video" class="md-assembly  media-overlay-link print-false" data-assembly-id="207548"><div class="md-assembly-wrapper" data-type="video"><div class="image-wrapper mg"><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/700x450/95/186695-049-A0FB6283.jpg" alt="ICL 2966 computer" data-width="426" data-height="240"></div></div><figcaption><strong class="md-assembly-title">ICL 2966 computer</strong><span class="md-assembly-caption">Learn about the ICL 2966, a mainframe computer utilizing integrated circuit technology, made in the United Kingdom in the 1980s.</span><cite>© Open University</cite></figcaption></figure></li></ul><!--[ML144]--></section></section><span id="ref216051" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref216066" data-level="3"><h2 class="h3"><span id="ref724237"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/time-sharing" class="md-crosslink">Time-sharing</a> and minicomputers</h2><span id="ref216051" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref216067" data-level="4"><h2 class="h4">Time-sharing from Project MAC to UNIX</h2><p>In 1959 Christopher Strachey in the United Kingdom and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-McCarthy" class="md-crosslink autoxref">John McCarthy</a> in the United States independently described something they called time-sharing. Meanwhile, computer pioneer <span id="ref724239"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Carl-Robnett-Licklider" class="md-crosslink">J.C.R. Licklider</a> at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) began to promote the idea of <span id="ref724240"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/interactive-mode" class="md-crosslink">interactive computing</a> as an alternative to batch processing. <span id="ref724238"></span>Batch processing was the normal mode of operating computers at the time: a user handed a deck of punched cards to an operator, who fed them to the machine, and an hour or more later the printed output would be made available for pickup. Licklider’s notion of interactive programming involved typing on a teletype or other keyboard and getting more or less immediate feedback from the computer on the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/teleprinter" class="md-crosslink autoxref">teletype’s</a> printer <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/mechanism-machinery" class="md-crosslink autoxref">mechanism</a> or some other output device.

It was built by <span id="ref724255"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fernando-Jose-Corbato" class="md-crosslink">Fernando Corbato</a> and Robert Jano at MIT, and it connected an IBM 709 computer with three users typing away at IBM Flexowriters. This was only a prototype for a more elaborate time-sharing system that Corbato was working on, called <span id="ref724275"></span>Compatible Time-Sharing System, or CTSS. Still, Corbato was waiting for the appropriate technology to build that system. It was clear that electromechanical and vacuum tube technologies would not be adequate for the computational demands that time-sharing would place on the machines. Fast, transistor-based computers were needed.</p><!--[P146]--><p>In the meantime, Licklider had been placed in charge of a U.S. government program called the <span id="ref724295"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Defense-Advanced-Research-Projects-Agency" class="md-crosslink">Advanced Research Projects Agency</a> (ARPA), created in response to the launch of the Sputnik satellite by the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Soviet-Union" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Soviet Union</a> in 1957. ARPA researched interesting technological areas, and under Licklider’s leadership it focused on time-sharing and interactive computing. With ARPA support, CTSS evolved into <span id="ref724355"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Project-Mac" class="md-crosslink">Project MAC</a>, which went online in 1963.</p><!--[P147]--><p>Project MAC was only the beginning. Other similar time-sharing projects followed rapidly at various research institutions, and some commercial products began to be released that also were called interactive or time-sharing. (The role of ARPA in creating another time-sharing network, ARPANET, became the foundation of the Internet and is discussed in a later section, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer/History-of-computing#ref216094" class="md-crosslink">The Internet</a>.)</p><!--[P148]--><p>Time-sharing represented a different interaction model, and it needed a new programming language to support it. Researchers created several such languages, most notably <span id="ref724375"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/BASIC" class="md-crosslink">BASIC</a> (Beginner’s All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code), which was invented in 1964 at <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Dartmouth-College" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Dartmouth College</a>, Hanover, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/New-Hampshire-state" class="md-crosslink autoxref">New Hampshire</a>, by <span id="ref724395"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-George-Kemeny" class="md-crosslink">John Kemeny</a> and <span id="ref724415"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Kurtz" class="md-crosslink">Thomas Kurtz</a>. BASIC had features that made it ideal for time-sharing, and it was easy enough to be used by its target audience: college students. Kemeny and Kurtz wanted to open computers to a broader group of users and deliberately designed BASIC with that goal in mind. They succeeded.</p><!--[P149]--><p>Time-sharing also called for a new kind of operating system. Researchers at <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/ATandT-Corporation" class="md-crosslink">AT&amp;T</a> (American Telephone and Telegraph Company) and <span id="ref724435"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/General-Electric" class="md-crosslink">GE</a> tackled the problem with funding from ARPA via Project MAC and an ambitious plan to implement time-sharing on a new computer with a new time-sharing-oriented operating system. AT&amp;T dropped out after the project was well under way, but GE went ahead, and the result was the <span id="ref724476"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Multics" class="md-crosslink">Multics</a> operating system running on the <span id="ref724436"></span>GE 645 computer. GE 645 exemplified the time-shared computer in 1965, and Multics was the model of a time-sharing operating system, built to be up seven days a week, 24 hours a day.</p><!--[P150]--><p>When AT&amp;T dropped out of the project and removed the GE machines from its laboratories, researchers at AT&amp;T’s high-tech research arm, <span id="ref724475"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Bell-Laboratories" class="md-crosslink">Bell Laboratories</a>, were upset. They felt they needed the time-sharing capabilities of Multics for their work, and so two Bell Labs workers, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, wrote their own operating system. Since the operating system was inspired by Multics but would initially be somewhat simpler, they called it <span id="ref724495"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/UNIX" class="md-crosslink">UNIX</a>.</p><!--[P151]--><p>UNIX embodied, among other innovations, the notion of pipes. Pipes allowed a user to pass the results of one program to another program for use as input. This led to a style of programming in which small, targeted, single-function programs were joined together to achieve a more complicated goal. Perhaps the most influential aspect of UNIX, though, was that Bell Labs distributed the source code (the uncompiled, human-readable form of the code that made up the operating system) freely to colleges and universities—but made no offer to support it. The freely distributed source code led to a rapid, and somewhat divergent, evolution of UNIX. Whereas initial support was attracted by its free availability, its <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/robust" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="robust">robust</a> <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/multitasking" class="md-crosslink autoxref">multitasking</a> and well-developed network security features have continued to make it the most common operating system for academic institutions and World Wide Web servers.</p><!--[P152]--></section><span id="ref216051" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref216068" data-level="4"><h2 class="h4"><span id="ref724496"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/minicomputer" class="md-crosslink">Minicomputers</a></h2><p>About 1965, roughly <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coterminous" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="coterminous">coterminous</a> with the development of time-sharing, a new kind of computer came on the scene. Small and relatively inexpensive (typically one-tenth the cost of the Big Iron machines), the new machines were stored-program computers with all the generality of the computers then in use but stripped down. The new machines were called minicomputers. (About the same time, the larger traditional computers began to be called <span id="ref724498"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/mainframe" class="md-crosslink">mainframes</a>.) Minicomputers were designed for easy connection to scientific instruments and other input/output devices, had a simplified architecture, were implemented using fast transistors, and were typically programmed in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/assembly-language" class="md-crosslink autoxref">assembly language</a> with little support for high-level languages.</p><!--[P153]--><p>Other small, inexpensive computing devices were available at the time but were not considered minicomputers.

At a price of $120,000, the PDP-1 sold for a fraction of the cost of mainframe computers, albeit with vastly more limited capabilities. But it was the PDP-8, using the recently invented <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/integrated-circuit" class="md-crosslink">integrated circuit</a> (a set of interconnected transistors and resistors on a single silicon wafer, or chip) and selling for around $20,000 (falling to $3,000 by the late 1970s), that was the first true mass-market minicomputer. The PDP-8 was released in 1965, the same year as the first IBM 360 machines.</p><!--[P156]--><p>The PDP-8 was the prototypical mini. It was designed to be programmed in assembly language; it was easy—physically, logically, and electrically—to attach a wide variety of input/output devices and scientific instruments to it; and it was architecturally stripped down with little support for programming—it even lacked multiplication and division operations in its initial release. It had a mere 4,096 words of memory, and its word length was 12 bits—very short even by the standards of the times. (The word is the smallest chunk of memory that a program can refer to independently; the size of the word limits the complexity of the instruction set and the efficiency of mathematical operations.) The PDP-8’s short word and small memory made it relatively underpowered for the time, but its low price more than compensated for this.</p><!--[P157]--><p>The PDP-11 shipped five years later, relaxing some of the constraints imposed on the PDP-8. It was designed to support high-level languages, had more memory and more power generally, was produced in 10 different models over 10 years, and was a great success. It was followed by the <span id="ref724502"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/VAX" class="md-crosslink">VAX</a> line, which supported an advanced operating system called <span id="ref724503"></span>VAX/VMS—VMS standing for virtual memory system, an innovation that effectively expanded the memory of the machine by allowing disk or other <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/peripheral" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="peripheral">peripheral</a> storage to serve as extra memory. By this time (the early 1970s) DEC was vying with Sperry Rand (manufacturer of the UNIVAC computer) for position as the second largest computer company in the world, though it was producing machines that had little in common with the original prototypical minis.</p><!--[P158]--><p>Although the minis’ early growth was due to their use as scientific instrument controllers and data loggers, their compelling feature turned out to be their approachability. After years of standing in line to use departmental, universitywide, or companywide machines through intermediaries, scientists and researchers could now buy their own computer and run it themselves in their own laboratories. And they had <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intimate" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="intimate">intimate</a> access to the internals of the machine, the stripped-down architecture making it possible for a smart graduate student to reconfigure the machine to do something not intended by the manufacturer. With their own computers in their labs, researchers began to use minis for all sorts of new purposes, and the manufacturers adapted later releases of the machines to the evolving demands of the market.</p><!--[P159]--><p>The minicomputer revolution lasted about a decade. By 1975 it was coming to a close, but not because minis were becoming less attractive. The mini was about to be eclipsed by another technology: the new <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/integrated" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="integrated">integrated</a> circuits, which would soon be used to build the smallest, most affordable computers to date. The rise of this new technology is described in the next section, The personal computer revolution.</p><!--[P160]--></section></section></section><section id="ref216069" data-level="2"><h2 class="h2">The <span id="ref724505"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/personal-computer" class="md-crosslink">personal computer</a> revolution</h2><p>Before 1970, computers were big machines requiring thousands of separate transistors. They were operated by specialized technicians, who often dressed in white lab coats and were commonly referred to as a computer priesthood. The machines were expensive and difficult to use. Few people came in direct contact with them, not even their programmers. The typical interaction was as follows: a programmer coded instructions and data on preformatted paper, a keypunch operator transferred the data onto punch cards, a computer operator fed the cards into a card reader, and the computer executed the instructions or stored the cards’ information for later processing. Advanced installations might allow users limited interaction with the computer more directly, but still remotely, via time-sharing through the use of cathode-ray tube terminals or teletype machines.</p><!--[P161]--><p>At the beginning of the 1970s there were essentially two types of computers. There were room-sized mainframes, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, that were built one at a time by companies such as IBM and CDC. There also were smaller, cheaper, mass-produced minicomputers, costing tens of thousands of dollars, that were built by a handful of companies, such as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Digital-Equipment-Corporation" class="md-crosslink">Digital Equipment Corporation</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hewlett-Packard-Company" class="md-crosslink">Hewlett-Packard Company</a>, for scientific laboratories and businesses.</p><!--[P162]--><p>Still, most people had no direct contact with either type of computer, and the machines were popularly viewed as impersonal giant brains that threatened to eliminate jobs through automation. The idea that anyone would have his or her own desktop computer was generally regarded as far-fetched. Nevertheless, with advances in integrated circuit technology, the necessary building blocks for desktop computing began to emerge in the early 1970s.</p><!--[P163]--><span id="ref216069" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref216070" data-level="3"><h2 class="h3">The <span id="ref724506"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/microprocessor" class="md-crosslink">microprocessor</a></h2><span id="ref216069" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref216071" data-level="4"><h2 class="h4"><span id="ref724504"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/integrated-circuit" class="md-crosslink">Integrated circuits</a></h2><p><span id="ref724507"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Shockley" class="md-crosslink">William Shockley</a>, a coinventor of the transistor, started Shockley Semiconductor Laboratories in 1955 in his hometown of Palo Alto, California.

It was, in fact, a calculator project that turned into a milestone in the history of computer technology.</p><!--[P166]--></section><span id="ref216069" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref216072" data-level="4"><h2 class="h4">The <span id="ref724516"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Intel-4004" class="md-crosslink">Intel 4004</a></h2><p>In 1969 <span id="ref724515"></span>Busicom, a Japanese calculator company, commissioned <span id="ref724519"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Intel" class="md-crosslink">Intel Corporation</a> to make the chips for a line of <span id="ref724514"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/calculator" class="md-crosslink">calculators</a> that Busicom intended to sell. Custom chips were made for many clients, and this was one more such contract, hardly unusual at the time.</p><!--[P167]--><p>Intel was one of several semiconductor companies to emerge in Silicon Valley, having spun off from Fairchild Semiconductor. Intel’s president, <span id="ref724517"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-Noyce" class="md-crosslink">Robert Noyce</a>, while at Fairchild, had invented planar integrated circuits, a process in which the wiring was directly embedded in the silicon along with the electronic components at the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/manufacturing" class="md-crosslink autoxref">manufacturing</a> stage.</p><!--[P168]--><p>Intel had planned on focusing its business on memory chips, but Busicom’s request for custom chips for a calculator turned out to be a most valuable diversion. While specialized chips were effective at their given task, their small market made them expensive. Three Intel engineers—Federico Faggin, <span id="ref724518"></span>Marcian (“Ted”) Hoff, and Stan Mazor—considered the request of the Japanese firm and proposed a more versatile design.</p><!--[P169]--><p>Hoff had experience with minicomputers, which could do anything the calculator could do and more. He rebelled at building a special-purpose device when the technology existed to build a general-purpose one. The general-purpose device he had in mind, however, would be a lot like a computer, and at that time computers intimidated people while calculators did not. Moreover, there was a clear and large market for calculators and a limited one for computers—and, after all, the customer had commissioned a calculator chip.</p><!--[P170]--><p>Nevertheless, Hoff prevailed, and Intel proposed a design that was functionally very similar to a minicomputer (although not in size, power, attachable physical devices such as printers, or many other practical ways). In addition to performing the input/output functions that most ICs carried out, the design would form the instructions for the IC and would help to control, send, and receive signals from other chips and devices. A set of instructions was stored in memory, and the chip could read them and respond to them. The device would thus do everything that Busicom wanted, but it would do a lot more: it was the essence of a general-purpose computer. There was little obvious demand for such a device, but the Intel team, understanding the drawbacks of special-purpose ICs, sensed that it was an economical device that would, somehow, find a market.</p><!--[P171]--><p>At first Busicom was not interested, but Intel decided to go forward with the design anyway, and the Japanese company eventually accepted it. Intel named the chip the 4004, which referred to the number of features and transistors it had. These included memory, input/output, control, and arithmetical/logical capacities. It came to be called a microprocessor or microcomputer. It is this chip that is referred to as the brain of the personal desktop computer—the central processing unit, or CPU.</p><!--[P172]--><p>Busicom eventually sold over 100,000 calculators powered by the 4004. Busicom later also accepted a one-time payment of $60,000 that gave Intel <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exclusive" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="exclusive">exclusive</a> rights to the 4004 design, and Intel began marketing the chip to other manufacturers in 1971.</p><!--[P173]--><p>The 4004 had significant limitations. As a four-bit processor, it was capable of only 2<sup>4</sup>, or 16, distinct combinations, or “words.” To distinguish the 26 letters of the alphabet and up to six punctuation symbols, the computer had to combine two four-bit words. Nevertheless, the 4004 achieved a level of fame when Intel found a high-profile customer for it: it was used on the <span id="ref724520"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Pioneer-space-probes" class="md-crosslink">Pioneer 10</a> space probe, launched on March 2, 1972.</p><!--[P174]--><p>It became a little easier to see the potential of microprocessors when Intel introduced an eight-bit processor, the <span id="ref724521"></span>8008, in November 1972. (In 1974 the 8008 was reengineered with a larger, more versatile instruction set as the <span id="ref724522"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Intel-8080" class="md-crosslink">8080</a>.) In 1972 Intel was still a small company, albeit with two new and revolutionary products.

It should not have taken a visionary to observe the trend of cheaper, faster, and more powerful devices. Nevertheless, even after the invention of the microprocessor, few could imagine a market for personal computers.</p><!--[P177]--><p>The advent of the microprocessor did not inspire IBM or any other large company to begin producing personal computers. Time after time, the big computer companies overlooked the opportunity to bring computing capabilities to a much broader market. In some cases, they turned down explicit proposals by their own engineers to build such machines. Instead, the new generation of microcomputers or personal computers emerged from the minds and passions of electronics hobbyists and entrepreneurs.</p><!--[P178]--><p>In the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/San-Francisco-Bay" class="md-crosslink autoxref">San Francisco Bay</a> area, the advances of the semiconductor industry were gaining recognition and stimulating a grassroots computer movement. Lee Felsenstein, an electronics engineer active in the student antiwar movement of the 1960s, started an organization called <span id="ref724524"></span>Community Memory to install computer terminals in storefronts. This movement was a sign of the times, an attempt by computer cognoscenti to empower the masses by giving ordinary individuals access to a public computer network.</p><!--[P179]--><p>The frustration felt by engineers and electronics hobbyists who wanted easier access to computers was expressed in articles in the electronics magazines in the early 1970s.

The TV Typewriter provided the first display of alphanumeric information on a common television set. It influenced a generation of computer hobbyists to start thinking about real “home-brewed” computers.</p><!--[P182]--><p>The next step was the personal computer itself. That same year a French company, R2E, developed the <span id="ref724531"></span>Micral microcomputer using the 8008 processor. The Micral was the first commercial, non-kit microcomputer. Although the company sold 500 Micrals in France that year, it was little known among American hobbyists.</p><!--[P183]--><p>Instead, a company called <span id="ref724532"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Micro-Instrumentation-and-Telemetry-Systems" class="md-crosslink">Micro Instrumentation Telemetry Systems</a>, which rapidly became known as MITS, made the big American splash.

It expanded into the kit calculator business in the early 1970s. This move was terribly ill-timed because other, larger manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard and Texas Instruments (itself a leading designer of ICs) soon moved into the market with mass-produced <span id="ref724533"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/calculator" class="md-crosslink">calculators</a>. As a result, calculators quickly became smaller, more powerful, and cheaper. By 1974 the average cost for a calculator had dropped from several hundred dollars to about $25, and MITS was on the verge of bankruptcy.</p><!--[P184]--><p>In need of a new product, MITS came up with the idea of selling a computer kit. The kit, containing all of the components necessary to build an Altair computer, sold for $397, barely more than the list cost of the Intel 8080 microprocessor that it used. A January 1975 cover article in <em>Popular Electronics</em> generated hundreds of orders for the kit, and MITS was saved.</p><!--[P185]--><p>The firm did its best to live up to its promise of delivery within 60 days, and to do so it limited manufacture to a bare-bones kit that included a box, a CPU board with 256 bytes of memory, and a front panel. The machines, especially the early ones, had only limited reliability. To make them work required many hours of assembly by an electronics expert.</p><!--[P186]--><p>When assembled, Altairs were blue, box-shaped machines that measured 17 inches by 18 inches by 7 inches (approximately 43 cm by 46 cm by 18 cm). There was no keyboard, video terminal, paper-tape reader, or printer. There was no software. All programming was in assembly language. The only way to input programs was by setting switches on the front panel for each instruction, step-by-step. A pattern of flashing lights on the front panel indicated the results of a program.</p><!--[P187]--><p>Just getting the Altair to blink its lights represented an accomplishment. Nevertheless, it sparked people’s interest. In Silicon Valley, members of a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nascent" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="nascent">nascent</a> hobbyist group called the <span id="ref724534"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Homebrew-Computer-Club" class="md-crosslink">Homebrew Computer Club</a> gathered around an Altair at one of their first meetings.

It had a bus structure, a data path for sending instructions throughout its circuitry that would allow it to house and communicate with <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/plug-in" class="md-crosslink autoxref">add-on</a> circuit boards.

The Microsoft Corporation went on to develop versions of BASIC for nearly every computer that was released. It also developed other high-level languages. When IBM eventually decided to enter the microcomputer business in 1980, it called on Microsoft for both a programming language and an operating system, and the small partnership was on its way to becoming the largest software company in the world.

Electric Pencil was one of the first programs that allowed nontechnical people to perform useful tasks on personal computers. Nevertheless, the early personal computer companies still underestimated the value of software, and many refused to pay the software developer to convert Electric Pencil to run on their machines. Eventually the availability of some software would play a major role in determining the success of a computer.</p><!--[P196]--><p>In 1979 a Harvard business graduate named Dan Bricklin and a programmer named Bob Frankston developed <span id="ref724550"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/VisiCalc" class="md-crosslink">VisiCalc</a>, the first personal computer financial analysis tool. VisiCalc made business forecasting much simpler, allowing individuals to ask “What if” questions about numerical data and get the sort of immediate response that was not even possible for giant corporations using mainframe computer systems. Personal Software, the company that distributed VisiCalc, became hugely successful. With a few companies such as Microsoft leading the way, a software industry separate from the hardware field began to emerge.</p><!--[P197]--></section></section></section><span id="ref216069" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref235877" data-level="3"><h2 class="h3">The <span id="ref724551"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/personal-computer" class="md-crosslink">personal computer</a></h2><span id="ref216069" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref235878" data-level="4"><h2 class="h4"><span id="ref724552"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Commodore-Business-Machines" class="md-crosslink">Commodore</a> and Tandy enter the field</h2><p>In late 1976 Commodore Business Machines, an established electronics firm that had been active in producing electronic calculators, bought a small hobby-computer company named MOS Technology.

When Hewlett-Packard, where he had an internship, declined to build his design, he shared his progress at a Homebrew meeting, where Jobs suggested that they could sell it together. Their initial plans were modest. Jobs figured that they could sell it for $50, twice what the parts cost them, and that they could sell hundreds of them to hobbyists. The product was actually only a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/printed-circuit" class="md-crosslink autoxref">printed circuit</a> board. It lacked a case, a keyboard, and a power supply. Jobs got an order for 50 of the machines from Paul Terrell, owner of one of the industry’s first computer retail stores and a frequent Homebrew attendee. To raise the capital to buy the parts they needed, Jobs sold his minibus and Wozniak his calculator. They met their 30-day deadline and continued production in Jobs’s parents’ garage.</p><!--[P201]--><p>After their initial success, Jobs sought out the kind of help that other industry pioneers had shunned. While he and Wozniak began work on the <span id="ref724559"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Apple-II" class="md-crosslink">Apple II</a>, he consulted with a venture capitalist and enlisted an advertising company to aid him in marketing. As a result, in late 1976 A.C. (“Mike”) Markkula, a retired semiconductor company executive, helped write a business plan for Apple, lined up credit from a bank, and hired a serious businessman to run the venture. Apple was clearly taking a different path from its competitors. For instance, while Altair and the other microcomputer start-ups ran advertisements in technical journals, Apple ran an early colour ad in <em>Playboy</em> magazine. Its executive team lined up nationwide distributors. Apple made sure each of its subsequent products featured an elegant, consumer-style design. It also published well-written and carefully designed manuals to instruct consumers on the use of the machines. Other manuals explained all the technical details any third-party hardware or software company would have to know to build peripherals. In addition, Apple quickly built well-engineered products that made the Apple II far more useful: a printer card, a serial card, a communications card, a memory card, and a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/floppy-disk" class="md-crosslink autoxref">floppy disk</a>. This distinctive approach <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/resonated" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="resonated">resonated</a> well in the marketplace.</p><!--[P202]--><p>In 1980 the <span id="ref724560"></span>Apple III was introduced. For this new computer Apple designed a new operating system, though it also offered a capability known as emulation that allowed the machine to run the same software, albeit much slower, as the Apple II. After several months on the market the Apple III was recalled so that certain defects could be repaired (proving that Apple was not immune to the technical failures from which most early firms suffered), but upon reintroduction to the marketplace it never achieved the success of its predecessor (demonstrating how difficult it can be for a company to introduce a computer that is not completely compatible with its existing product line).</p><!--[P203]--><p>Nevertheless, the flagship Apple II and successors in that line—the Apple II+, the Apple IIe, and the Apple IIc—made Apple into the leading personal computer company in the world. In 1980 it announced its first public stock offering, and its young founders became instant millionaires. After three years in business, Apple’s revenues had increased from $7.8 million to $117.9 million.</p><!--[P204]--></section><span id="ref216069" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref235880" data-level="4"><h2 class="h4">The <span id="ref724561"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/graphical-user-interface" class="md-crosslink">graphical user interface</a></h2><p>In 1982 Apple introduced its <span id="ref724562"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Lisa" class="md-crosslink">Lisa</a> computer, a much more powerful computer with many innovations.

In 1968, as a researcher at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), Engelbart gave a remarkable demonstration of the “<span id="ref724566"></span>NLS” (o<em>NL</em>ine <em>S</em>ystem), which featured a keyboard and a <span id="ref724565"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/mouse-computer-device" class="md-crosslink">mouse</a>, a device he had invented that was used to select commands from a menu of choices shown on a display screen.

In the coming years scientists at PARC pioneered many new technologies. Xerox built a prototype computer with a GUI operating system called the <span id="ref724569"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Alto-computer" class="md-crosslink">Alto</a> and eventually introduced a commercial version called the Xerox Star in 1981. Xerox’s efforts to market this computer were a failure, and the company withdrew from the market.

Ethernet eventually became the technical standard for connecting digital computers together in an office environment.</p><!--[P209]--><p>PARC researchers used Ethernet to connect their Altos together and to share another invention of theirs, the laser printer. Laser printers work by shooting a stream of light that gives a charge to the surface of a rotating drum. The charged area attracts toner powder so that when paper rolls over it an image is transferred. PARC programmers also developed numerous other innovations, such as the Smalltalk programming language, designed to make programming accessible to users who were not computer experts, and a text editor called Bravo, which displayed text on a computer screen exactly as it would look on paper.</p><!--[P210]--><p>Xerox PARC came up with these innovations but left it to others to commercialize them.

(<em>See</em> the earlier section <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer/History-of-computing#ref216065" class="md-crosslink">The IBM 360</a>.) Its long-term success was due largely to its ability to innovate and to adapt its business to technological change. “Big Blue,” as the company was commonly known, introduced the first computer disk storage system, the <span id="ref724595"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/RAMAC" class="md-crosslink">RAMAC</a>, which showed off its capabilities by answering world history questions in 10 languages at the 1958 World’s Fair. From 1956 to 1971 IBM sales had grown from $900 million to $8 billion, and its number of employees had increased from 72,500 to 270,000. IBM had also innovated new marketing techniques such as the unbundling of hardware, software, and computer services. So it was not a surprise that IBM would enter the fledgling but promising personal computer business.</p><!--[P213]--><p>In fact, right from project <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conception" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="conception">conception</a>, IBM took an intelligent approach to the personal computer field. It noticed that the market for personal computers was spreading rapidly among both businesses and individuals. To move more rapidly than usual, IBM recruited a team of 12 engineers to build a prototype computer. Once the project was approved, IBM picked another small team of engineers to work on the project at its <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Boca-Raton" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Boca Raton</a>, Florida, laboratories. Philip Estridge, manager of the project, owned an Apple II and appreciated its open architecture, which allowed for the easy development of add-on products. IBM contracted with other companies to produce components for their computer and to base it on an open architecture that could be built with commercially available materials. With this plan, IBM would be able to avoid corporate bottlenecks and bring its computer to market in a year, more rapidly than competitors. Intel Corporation’s 16-bit 8088 microprocessor was selected as the central processing unit (CPU) for the computer, and for software IBM turned to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Microsoft-Corporation" class="md-crosslink">Microsoft Corporation</a>. Until then the small software company had concentrated mostly on computer languages, but <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bill-Gates" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Bill Gates</a> and Paul Allen found it impossible to turn down this opportunity. They purchased a small operating system from another company and turned it into PC-DOS (or MS-DOS, or sometimes just <span id="ref724615"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/MS-DOS" class="md-crosslink">DOS</a>, for disk operating system), which quickly became the standard operating system for the IBM Personal Computer. IBM had first approached Digital Research to inquire about its <span id="ref724635"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/CP-M" class="md-crosslink">CP/M</a> operating system, but Digital’s executives balked at signing IBM’s nondisclosure agreement. Later IBM also offered a version of CP/M but priced it higher than DOS, sealing the fate of the operating system. In reality, DOS resembled CP/M in both <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/function-mathematics" class="md-crosslink autoxref">function</a> and appearance, and users of CP/M found it easy to convert to the new IBM machines.</p><!--[P214]--><p>IBM had the benefit of its own experience to know that <span id="ref724636"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/software" class="md-crosslink">software</a> was needed to make a computer useful. In preparation for the release of its computer, IBM contracted with several software companies to develop important applications. From day one it made available a word processor, a spreadsheet program, and a series of business programs. Personal computers were just starting to gain acceptance in businesses, and in this market IBM had a built-in advantage, as expressed in the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adage" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="adage">adage</a> “Nobody was ever fired for buying from IBM.”</p><!--[P215]--><p>IBM named its product the IBM Personal Computer, which quickly was shortened to the <span id="ref724637"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/IBM-PC" class="md-crosslink">IBM PC</a>. It was an immediate success, selling more than 500,000 units in its first two years. More powerful than other desktop computers at the time, it came with 16 kilobytes of memory (expandable to 256 kilobytes), one or two floppy disk drives, and an optional colour monitor. The giant company also took an unlikely but wise marketing approach by selling the IBM PC through computer dealers and in department stores, something it had never done before.</p><!--[P216]--><p>IBM’s entry into personal computers broadened the market and energized the industry. Software developers, aware of Big Blue’s immense resources and anticipating that the PC would be successful, set out to write programs for the computer. Even competitors benefited from the attention that IBM brought to the field; and when they realized that they could build machines compatible with the IBM PC, the industry rapidly changed.</p><!--[P217]--></section><span id="ref216069" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref235882" data-level="4"><h2 class="h4">The market expands</h2><span id="ref216069" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref235883" data-level="5"><h2 class="h5"><span id="ref724639"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/clone-computer-science" class="md-crosslink">PC clones</a></h2><p>In 1982 a well-funded start-up firm called <span id="ref724638"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Compaq-Computer-Corporation" class="md-crosslink">Compaq Computer Corporation</a> came out with a portable computer that was compatible with the IBM PC. These first portables resembled sewing machines when they were closed and weighed about 28 pounds (approximately 13 kg)—at the time a true lightweight. Compatibility with the IBM PC meant that any software or peripherals, such as printers, developed for use with the IBM PC would also work on the Compaq portable. The machine caught IBM by surprise and was an immediate success. Compaq was not only successful but showed other firms how to compete with IBM. Quickly thereafter many computer firms began offering “PC clones.” IBM’s decision to use off-the-shelf parts, which once seemed brilliant, had altered the company’s ability to control the computer industry as it always had with previous generations of technology.</p><!--[P218]--><div class="assemblies"><figure data-type="image" class="md-assembly  media-overlay-link print-false" data-assembly-id="19722"><div class="md-assembly-wrapper" data-type="image"><div class="image-wrapper mg"><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/700x450/80/27080-004-3D09DDD7.jpg" big-src="https://cdn.britannica.com/80/27080-004-3D09DDD7.jpg" alt="The Compaq portable computerCompaq Computer Corporation introduced the first IBM-compatible portable computer in November 1982.

Apple’s Macintosh was successful, but it could never hope to attract the customer base of all the companies building IBM PC compatibles. Eventually software companies began to favour the PC makers with more of their development efforts, and Apple’s market share began to drop. Apple cofounder Stephen Wozniak left in February 1985 to become a teacher, and Apple cofounder Steven Jobs was ousted in a power struggle in September 1985. During the ensuing turmoil, Apple held on to its loyal customer base, thanks to its innovative user interface and overall ease of use, but its market share continued to erode as lower-costing PCs began to catch up with, and even pass, Apple’s technological lead.</p><!--[P219]--></section><span id="ref216069" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref235884" data-level="5"><h2 class="h5"><span id="ref724642"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Microsoft-Corporation" class="md-crosslink">Microsoft</a>’s <span id="ref724641"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Windows-OS" class="md-crosslink">Windows</a> operating system</h2><p>In 1985 Microsoft came out with its Windows operating system, which gave PC compatibles some of the same capabilities as the Macintosh.

IBM tried to establish yet another operating system, OS/2, but lost the battle to Gates’s company. In fact, Microsoft also had established itself as the leading provider of application software for the Macintosh.

The new machines were called workstations. They looked like personal computers, and they sat on a single desktop and were used by a single individual just like personal computers, but they were distinguished by being more powerful and expensive, by having more complex architectures that spread the computational load over more than one CPU chip, by usually running the UNIX operating system, and by being targeted to scientists and engineers, software and chip designers, graphic artists, moviemakers, and others needing high performance. Workstations existed in a narrow <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/niche" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="niche">niche</a> between the cheapest minicomputers and the most powerful personal computers, and each year they had to become more powerful, pushing at the minicomputers even as they were pushed at by the high-end personal computers.</p><!--[P221]--><p>The most successful of the workstation manufacturers were <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sun-Microsystems-Inc" class="md-crosslink">Sun Microsystems</a>, Inc., started by people involved in <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enhancing" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="enhancing">enhancing</a> the UNIX operating system, and, for a time, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/SGI" class="md-crosslink">Silicon Graphics</a>, Inc., which marketed machines for video and audio editing.</p><!--[P222]--><p>The microcomputer market now included personal computers, software, peripheral devices, and workstations.

Compaq announced that it intended to fold DEC technology into its own expanding product line and that the DEC <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/trademark" class="md-crosslink autoxref">brand name</a> would be gradually phased out.

The first large wave was the mainframe era, when many people had to share single machines. (The mainframe era is covered in the section <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer/History-of-computing#ref216051" class="md-crosslink">The age of Big Iron</a>.) In this view, the minicomputer era can be seen as a mere eddy in the larger wave, a development that allowed a favoured few to have greater contact with the big machines. Overall, the age of mainframes could be characterized by the expression “Many persons, one computer.”</p><!--[P224]--><p>The second wave of computing history was brought on by the personal computer, which in turn was made possible by the invention of the microprocessor. (This era is described in the section <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer/History-of-computing#ref216069" class="md-crosslink">The personal computer revolution</a>.) The impact of personal computers has been far greater than that of mainframes and minicomputers: their processing power has overtaken that of the minicomputers, and networks of personal computers working together to solve problems can be the equal of the fastest supercomputers. The era of the personal computer can be described as the age of “One person, one computer.”</p><!--[P225]--><p>Since the introduction of the first personal computer, the <span id="ref724676"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/semiconductor" class="md-crosslink">semiconductor</a> business has grown to more than a quarter-trillion-dollar worldwide industry. However, this phenomenon is only partly ascribable to the general-purpose microprocessor, which accounts for about one-sixth of annual sales. The greatest growth in the semiconductor industry has occurred in the manufacture of special-purpose processors, controllers, and digital signal processors. These computer chips are increasingly being included, or embedded, in a vast array of consumer devices, including pagers, mobile telephones, music players, automobiles, televisions, digital cameras, kitchen appliances, video games, and toys. While the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Intel" class="md-crosslink">Intel Corporation</a> may be safely said to dominate the worldwide microprocessor business, it has been outpaced in this rapidly growing multibillion-dollar industry by companies such as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Motorola-Inc" class="md-crosslink">Motorola, Inc.</a>; <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hitachi-Ltd" class="md-crosslink">Hitachi, Ltd.</a>; <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Texas-Instruments-Incorporated" class="md-crosslink">Texas Instruments Incorporated</a>; <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/NEC-Corporation" class="md-crosslink">NEC Corporation</a>; and Lucent Technologies Inc.

Kay never actually built a Dynabook (the technology had yet to be invented), but his vision helped to catalyze the research that would eventually make his dream feasible.</p><!--[P227]--><p>It happened by small steps. The popularity of the personal computer and the ongoing miniaturization of the semiconductor circuitry and other devices first led to the development of somewhat smaller, portable—or, as they were sometimes called, luggable—computer systems. The first of these, the <span id="ref724679"></span>Osborne 1, designed by Lee Felsenstein, an electronics engineer active in the Homebrew Computer Club in San Francisco, was sold in 1981. Soon most PC manufacturers had portable models. At first these portables looked like sewing machines and weighed in excess of 20 pounds (9 kg). Gradually they became smaller (laptop-, notebook-, and then sub-notebook-size) and came with more powerful processors. These devices allowed people to use computers not only in the office or at home but also while traveling—on airplanes, in waiting rooms, or even at the beach.</p><!--[P228]--><p>As the size of computers continued to shrink and microprocessors became more and more powerful, researchers and entrepreneurs explored new possibilities in mobile computing. In the late 1980s and early ’90s, several companies came out with handheld computers, called <span id="ref724680"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/PDA" class="md-crosslink">personal digital assistants</a> (PDAs). PDAs typically replaced the cathode-ray-tube screen with a more compact <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/liquid-crystal-display" class="md-crosslink autoxref">liquid crystal display</a>, and they either had a miniature keyboard or replaced the keyboard with a stylus and handwriting-recognition software that allowed the user to write directly on the screen. Like the first personal computers, PDAs were built without a clear idea of what people would do with them. In fact, people did not do much at all with the early models. To some extent, the early PDAs, made by Go Corporation and Apple, were technologically premature; with their unreliable handwriting recognition, they offered little advantage over paper-and-pencil planning books.</p><!--[P229]--><p>The potential of this new kind of device was realized in 1996 when Palm Computing, Inc., released the <span id="ref724681"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Palm-Pilot" class="md-crosslink">Palm Pilot</a>, which was about the size of a deck of playing cards and sold for about $400—approximately the same price as the MITS Altair, the first personal computer sold as a kit in 1974. The Pilot did not try to replace the computer but made it possible to organize and carry information with an electronic <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/calendar" class="md-crosslink autoxref">calendar</a>, telephone number and address list, memo pad, and expense-tracking software and to synchronize that data with a PC. The device included an electronic cradle to connect to a PC and pass information back and forth. It also featured a data-entry system called “graffiti,” which involved writing with a stylus using a slightly altered alphabet that the device recognized. Its success encouraged numerous software companies to develop applications for it.</p><!--[P230]--><div class="assemblies"><figure data-type="image" class="md-assembly  media-overlay-link print-false" data-assembly-id="19228"><div class="md-assembly-wrapper" data-type="image"><div class="image-wrapper mg"><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/700x450/15/23615-004-6599FB73.jpg" big-src="https://cdn.britannica.com/15/23615-004-6599FB73.jpg" alt="The Palm Pilot personal digital assistant (PDA)Introduced in March 1997, this PDA model was equipped with enough processing power to store and manipulate personal information, as well as handle the most common scheduling tasks." data-width="237" data-height="300"></div></div><figcaption><span class="md-assembly-caption">The Palm Pilot personal digital assistant (PDA)Introduced in March 1997, this PDA model was equipped with enough processing power to store and manipulate personal information, as well as handle the most common scheduling tasks.</span><cite>Courtesy of 3Com Corporation</cite></figcaption></figure></div><!--[ML230]--><p>In 1998 this market heated up further with the entry of several established consumer electronics firms using <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Windows-OS" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Microsoft’s Windows</a> CE operating system (a stripped-down version of the Windows system) to sell <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/PDA" class="md-crosslink autoxref">handheld computer</a> devices and wireless telephones that could connect to PCs. These small devices also often possessed a communications component and benefited from the sudden popularization of the Internet and the World Wide Web.

The first network component, <span id="ref724683"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/ARPANET" class="md-crosslink">ARPANET</a>, became operational in October 1969. With only 15 nongovernment (university) sites included in ARPANET, the U.S. National Science Foundation decided to fund the construction and initial maintenance cost of a supplementary network, the <span id="ref724684"></span>Computer Science Network (CSNET). Built in 1980, CSNET was made available, on a subscription basis, to a wide array of academic, government, and industry research labs. As the 1980s wore on, further networks were added. In <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/North-America" class="md-crosslink autoxref">North America</a> there were (among others): BITNET (Because It’s Time Network) from IBM, UUCP (UNIX-to-UNIX Copy Protocol) from Bell Telephone, <span id="ref724695"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/USENET" class="md-crosslink">USENET</a> (initially a connection between <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Duke-University" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Duke University</a>, Durham, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/North-Carolina-state" class="md-crosslink autoxref">North Carolina</a>, and the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/University-of-North-Carolina" class="md-crosslink autoxref">University of North Carolina</a> and still the home system for the Internet’s many newsgroups), NSFNET (a high-speed <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Science-Foundation" class="md-crosslink autoxref">National Science Foundation</a> network connecting supercomputers), and CDNet (in Canada). In Europe several small academic networks were linked to the growing North American network.</p><!--[P234]--><p>All these various networks were able to communicate with one another because of two shared protocols: the <span id="ref724715"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/TCP-IP" class="md-crosslink">Transmission-Control Protocol</a> (TCP), which split large files into numerous small files, or packets, assigned sequencing and address information to each packet, and reassembled the packets into the original file after arrival at their final destination; and the Internet Protocol (IP), a hierarchical addressing system that controlled the routing of packets (which might take widely divergent paths before being reassembled).</p><!--[P235]--><p>What it took to turn a network of computers into something more was the idea of the hyperlink: computer code inside a document that would cause related documents to be fetched and displayed. The concept of hyperlinking was anticipated from the early to the middle decades of the 20th century—in Belgium by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Paul-Otlet" class="md-crosslink">Paul Otlet</a> and in the United States by Ted Nelson, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Vannevar-Bush" class="md-crosslink">Vannevar Bush</a>, and, to some extent, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Douglas-Engelbart" class="md-crosslink">Douglas Engelbart</a>.

The Web grew exponentially, doubling the number of users and the number of sites every few months. Uniform resource locators (URLs) became part of daily life, and the use of electronic mail (e-mail) became commonplace. Increasingly business took advantage of the Internet and adopted new forms of buying and selling in “cyberspace.” (Science fiction author William Gibson popularized this term in the early 1980s.) With Netscape so successful, Microsoft and other firms developed alternative Web browsers.</p><!--[P237]--><p>Originally created as a closed network for researchers, the Internet was suddenly a new public medium for information.

Second Life challenged the boundary between real and virtual economies, with some people earning significant incomes by providing services such as designing and selling virtual <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/dress-clothing" class="md-crosslink autoxref">clothing</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/furniture" class="md-crosslink autoxref">furniture</a>. In addition, many real world businesses, educational institutions, and political organizations found it advantageous to set up virtual shops in Second Life.</p><!--[P241]--><p>Maintaining an Internet presence became common for conventional businesses during the 1990s and 2000s as they sought to reach out to a public that was increasingly active in online social <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/communities" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="communities">communities</a>. In addition to seeking some way of responding to the growing numbers of their customers who were sharing their experiences with company products and services online, companies discovered that many potential customers searched online for the best deals and the locations of nearby businesses. With an Internet-enabled smartphone, a customer might, for example, check for nearby restaurants using its built-in access to the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/GPS" class="md-crosslink">Global Positioning System</a> (GPS), check a map on the Web for directions to the restaurant, and then call for a reservation, all while en route.</p><!--[P242]--><p>The growth of online business was accompanied, though, by a rise in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/cybercrime" class="md-crosslink">cybercrime</a>, particularly <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/identity-theft" class="md-crosslink autoxref">identity theft</a>, in which a criminal might gain access to someone’s <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/credit-card" class="md-crosslink autoxref">credit card</a> or other identification and use it to make purchases.</p><!--[P243]--></section><span id="ref216089" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref279801" data-level="4"><h2 class="h4"><span id="ref1071158"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/social-network" class="md-crosslink">Social networking</a></h2><p>Social networking services emerged as a significant online phenomenon in the 2000s. These services used software to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/facilitate" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="facilitate">facilitate</a> online communities, where members with shared interests swapped files, photographs, videos, and music, sent messages and chatted, set up <span id="ref1071159"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/blog" class="md-crosslink">blogs</a> (Web diaries) and discussion groups, and shared opinions. Early social networking services included Classmates.com, which connected former schoolmates, and Yahoo! 360°, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Myspacecom" class="md-crosslink">Myspace</a>, and SixDegrees, which built networks of connections via friends of friends. By 2018 the leading social networking services included <span id="ref1071186"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Facebook" class="md-crosslink">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Twitter" class="md-crosslink">Twitter</a>, Instagram, <span id="ref1071188"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/LinkedIn" class="md-crosslink">LinkedIn</a>, and Snapchat. LinkedIn became an effective tool for business staff recruiting. Businesses began exploring how to exploit these networks, drawing on social networking research and theory which suggested that finding key “influential” members of existing networks of individuals could give access to and credibility with the whole network.</p><!--[P244]--><p>Blogs became a category unto themselves, and some blogs had thousands of participants. Trust became a commodity, as sharing opinions or ratings proved to be a key to effective blog discussions, as well as an important component of many e-commerce Web sites. <span id="ref1071191"></span>Daily Kos, one of the largest of the political blogs, made good use of ratings, with high-rated members gaining more power to rate other members’ comments; under such systems, the idea is that the best entries will survive and the worst will quickly disappear. The vendor rating system in eBay similarly allowed for a kind of self-policing that was intended to weed out unethical or otherwise undesirable vendors.</p><!--[P245]--></section><span id="ref216089" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref216095" data-level="4"><h2 class="h4"><span id="ref724725"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/ubiquitous-computing" class="md-crosslink">Ubiquitous computing</a></h2><p>The combination of the connectedness of the Internet with the ability of new <span id="ref1071192"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/microprocessor" class="md-crosslink">microprocessors</a> that can handle multiple tasks in parallel has inspired new ways of programming. Programmers are developing software to divide computational tasks into subtasks that a program can assign to separate processors in order to achieve greater efficiency and speed. This trend is one of various ways that computers are being connected to share information and to solve complex problems. In such <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/distributed-computing" class="md-crosslink autoxref">distributed computing</a> applications as airline reservation systems and automated teller machines, data pass through networks connected all over the world. Distributed computing promises to make better use of computers connected to ever larger and more complex networks. In effect, a distributed network of personal computers becomes a <span id="ref1071193"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/supercomputer" class="md-crosslink">supercomputer</a>. Many applications, such as research into protein folding, have been done on distributed networks, and some of these applications have involved calculations that would be too demanding for any single computer in existence.</p><!--[P246]--><p>Considerable work in research laboratories is extending the actual development of embedded microprocessors to a more sweeping vision in which these chips will be found everywhere and will meet human needs wherever people go. For instance, the <span id="ref724724"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/GPS" class="md-crosslink">Global Positioning System</a> (GPS)—a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/satellite-communication" class="md-crosslink autoxref">satellite communication</a> and positioning system developed for the U.S. military—is now accessible by anyone, anywhere in the world, via a special commercial GPS receiver. In conjunction with various computer-mapping softwares, GPS can be used to locate one’s position and plan a travel route, whether by car or on foot.</p><!--[P247]--><p>Some researchers call this trend ubiquitous computing or <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pervasive" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="pervasive">pervasive</a> computing. Ubiquitous computing would extend the increasingly networked world and the powerful capabilities of distributed computing—i.e., the sharing of computations among microprocessors connected over a network. (The use of multiple microprocessors within one machine is discussed in the article <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/supercomputer" class="md-crosslink">supercomputer</a>.) With more powerful computers, all connected all the time, thinking machines would be involved in every facet of human life, albeit invisibly.</p><!--[P248]--><p><span id="ref1071194"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Xerox-PARC" class="md-crosslink">Xerox PARC</a>’s vision and research in the 1960s and ’70s eventually achieved commercial success in the form of the mouse-driven graphical user interface, networked computers, laser printers, and notebook-style machines. Today the vision of ubiquitous computing foresees a day when microprocessors will be found wherever humans go. The technology will be invisible and natural and will respond to normal patterns of behaviour. Computers will disappear, or rather become a transparent part of the physical environment, thus truly bringing about an era of “One person, many computers.”</p><!--[P249]--></section></section></section><span class="md-signature"><a href="/contributor/Paul-A-Freiberger/4495">Paul A.
