Itwas first working (in secret) in 1945, and was unveiled to the public inFebruary 1946. It was built under<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090105031620/http://www.library.upenn.edu/special/gallery/mauchly/jwmintro.html"><b>John W.

It was ahighly secret operation, with its existence barely acknowledged for decades.There was no contemporary published material. Nearly all the machinery anddocumentation was destroyed immediately after the war. Its key contribution wasthat people closely involved, as they moved into civilian occupations, wouldhave both a vision of future possibilities and useful practical experience.<p><a href="turing.html"><b>Alan M. Turing</b></a>, who published his now famouspaper introducing the Turing Machine in 1937, made a<a href="turing.html#bombe">key contribution</a>in the period 1939 to 1942 to the work at Bletchley Park, not only on thetheoretical side (for breaking both the Enigma and Lorenz codes), but alsodesigning the<a href="notes.html#bombe">"Bombe"</a> to help in breaking the Enigma codes.Although he was not directly involved in the later (and very different)Colossus project, he acted as a consultant and was aware of what was happening.He saw that the addition of a stored-program capability to the speedof Colossus would create a practical realisation of his Universal TuringMachine.In 1945 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090105031620/http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/bio/part5.html">he was asked todesign ACE</a> for the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), which was thefirst U.K. project to capitalise on the potential for a general-purposecomputer as a result of the experience of Colossus. Turing completed an initialbasic detailed design by the end of 1945, making a set of more advanced designsin the first half of 1946. He worked largely independent of outside influences,but the project stagnated for a couple of years, by which time Turing had left.<p>Max Newman moved to the University of Manchester as a professor in theMathematics department, bringing two mathematicians from Bletchley Park withhim, and in 1946 acquired a substantial grant to developcomputers. He originally planned to build a computer using current US techniquesand components, notably the ill-fated <a href="#selectron">Selectron</a> for hisstore. He would then use this to investigate uses of the computer, especiallyin pure mathematics. However his planned initiative was overtaken by the rapidprogress of <a href="williams.html"><b>Freddie C. Williams</b></a> and<a href="kilburn.html"><b>Tom Kilburn</b></a> in the Electrical Engineering department,which culminated in the successful working of the "Baby" in June 1948. The workwas <a href="new.baby.html#trefund">effectively funded by TRE</a>, and was led byProfessor Williams, with Newman acting as consultant for programming andmathematical matters. Newman recruited Turing to his staff in September 1948,and from 1949 to 1951 Turing made a significant practical contribution<a href="maths.html#turingsoft">on the software side</a> to the continuingdevelopment of the Manchester Mark 1 and the Ferranti Mark 1. A furthersignificant contributionfrom Newman and Turing was that they were enthusiastic early users of the Babyand Mark 1 for serious research (in Mathematics). In the end the first majorcall on Newman's grant was in October 1948 to pay Turing's salary and part ofthe salary bill for the new staff joining the Electrical Engineering department.The bulk of the grant was spent on the new computer building at the University,to house the first Ferranti Mark 1 in 1951.<h3 align="center"><a name="eniac">The Legacy of ENIAC</a></h3><p>ENIAC in contrast was central to the evolution of computers. It proved publiclythat a large electronic digital machine was viable and useful. The need foran effective electronic random access store to make further progress was wellunderstood -- but the meansof achieving it seemed fraught with difficulty! In 1945 work was already inhand to design the successor to ENIAC,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090105031620/http://ftp.arl.mil/~mike/comphist/61ordnance/chap3.html">EDVAC</a>.This would include an effectiveelectronic Random Access Memory(<a href="#stores">well, nearly random access!</a>) and thestored-program principle, i.e. the RAM would contain program as well as data,allowing for easy change of program and fast execution of programs. An earlydraft report was written by von Neumann, which resulted in the classic basiccomputer design being labelled the "<b>von Neumann computer</b>". (Sad as itis for joint pioneers, at least the public is grateful that it hasn't been knownas e.g. the Mauchly-Eckert-von-Neumann computer --  or the Williams Tube as the<a href="notes.html#willkil">Williams-Kilburn Tube</a>!)<p><a name="moore">After a couple of years</a> the design of EDVAC was finalised, and work started tobuild it. But the next key event wasthe <a href="moore.school/index.html"><b>Course at the Moore School</b></a> <i>"Theory and Techniques for the Design ofElectronic Computers"</i>, given by inter alia Eckert, Mauchly, von Neumann, andAiken, in July-August 1946. This was attended by a number of people fromorganisations interested in the potential of electronic computers, includingtwo from the U.K., and it had a major impact in the US. Also it directlyinspired one of the three major U.K. projects, the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090105031620/http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/UoCCL/misc/EDSAC99/history.html">EDSAC</a>under <b>Maurice V. Wilkes</b> at Cambridge University, which was closely basedon the EDVAC design. A second U.K. project, the Manchester Mark 1, was notdirectly influenced by the lectures, but Freddie Williams, while visiting anumber of places in the US in June 1946, saw the ENIAC, and he was impressed atthe evidence that such a large electronic machine could be kept error free forlong enough to make useful calculations. He was aware of the desperate needfor an effective electronic storage system as the next step, and his decision totry and solve the storage problem using Cathode Ray Tubes led directly to theBaby and the Mark 1.<h3 align="center"><a name="noteniac">Pioneer Computers NOT deriving fromENIAC</a></h3><p>It is worth pointing out that if ENIAC had not existed (or had been kepttop-secret like Colossus), then there would nothave been any significant delay in computer evolution (except the weight ofthe US contribution might have been delayed a year or so). Turing almostcertainly had the greatest theoretical understanding of computers andtheir future potential in the world. He well understood the concept of thestored-program.The reason he was capable of doing the detailed design for ACE is that he hadset out in his last year or two at Bletchley Park to learn as much as he couldabout electronics, not only to assist in the portable speech-scrambling devicehe was working on, but because he saw in the electronic speed of Colossus theway forward towards his vision of the future.  If the other developmentshad not been taking place publicly around the world the British Authoritiesmight have been a bit slower initially in starting the project, but also theremight not have been the<a href="notes.html#acedelay">two-year hiatus</a> before NPL started to build (acut down version of) Turing's design.<p>It is also<a href="notes.html#perhaps">quite possible</a> that Williams could have had hisinterest sparked from the U.K. rather than the U.S.; in particular it is quite possible that he could have been co-opted by Newman. In any case theManchester project owed very little directly to the ENIAC, the Moore Schoolcourse or to the EDVAC report (except that the ENIAC satisfied Williams thatelectronic calculation on that scale was feasible, and he was aware that asuitable electronic store was essential to further development, with a CRT storebeing one of the less favoured ideas being floated). The detailed design of theEDVAC(and ACE) was of little use, based as it was on such a different store. Insofaras Williams and Kilburn needed external input on programming matters, by early1947 Williams was in regular contact with Newman, who in turn was in touch withTuring, and Kilburn had attended Turing's NPL lectures on the ACE design. Newmanhad sent a member of staff to the Moore School lectures and had visited theU.S. in late 1946 looking for a suitable model to base his machine on, sohe was generally well informed of progress on both sides of the Atlantic.Neither side was indispensable (so long as the other existed!)<p>Another machine which did not derive from the ENIAC, the EDVAC report or theMoore School course was the Australian<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090105031620/http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/csirac/">CSIRAC</a>, built underMaston Beard and Trevor Pearcey at the Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney.This wasinspired by Pearcey seeing the Harvard Mark I in 1945 and determining that hecould do better with a fully electronic stored-programmed computer. This wasdeveloped with relatively little input from the outside world, using Delay Linestore, and was first running test programs in late 1949, and was officiallyopened in 1951.<h3 align="center"><a name="stores">Electronic Random Access Memories</a></h3><p>In 1946, when people were moving from general design of new computersto detailed design, the storage device that seemed mostlikely to be working first,as the basis for the all-important main electronic store, was the<a href="notes.html#acousticdelay"><b>Mercury Acoustic Delay Line</b></a>.This had a major disadvantage that it was not trulyrandom-access, as you could only random-access a <em>block</em> of words at atime. If you wanted to access a particular word in the block, you had to waituntil the particular string of bits cycled past. This spoilt the von Neumannprinciple somewhat, as the default of taking instructions from successive storelocations would cause delays, so usually the instruction code of a DelayLine machine would provide a field to specify the address of the nextinstruction. It is likely that keeping things simple and avoiding thiscomplication made a considerable contribution to Wilkes having the firstmachine with a Delay Line store working.<p>Because of the inherent disadvantage of the Delay Line stores, designers werelooking towards electrostatic storage, where charge was controlled on thesurface of a dielectric to provide an array of "bit positions" that could beheld in one of two states indefinitely, but read and written at will. Thisprovided random access to words in the store. One general class of electrostaticstores proposed was based on the Cathode Ray Tube, with the array of chargeson the screen being powered by a scanning electron beam.<a href="williams.html">F.C. (Freddie) Williams</a> from the UK<a href="notes.html#tre">Telecommunications Research Establishment</a>, TRE, came back from his trip to the Stateswith the idea that he could built such a store based on the Cathode Ray Tubeshe was so familiar with from his war work in radar. By November he had shownhow to store a single digit, and by Autumn 1947, now at the University ofManchester, he and <a href="kilburn.html">Tom Kilburn</a> had demonstrated theycould store<a href="ip-mm1.crt2048.html">2048 bits</a> for a number of hours on a standardCRT. The <b>Williams-Kilburn CRT store</b> (also known as the<a href="/web/20090105031620/http://www.computer50.org/kgill/williams/williams.html">Williams Tube</a>) was a fast,cheap and more compact system than the Mercury Acoustic Delay Line. And itwas truly random access.However it was too late to be used by the machines already well into thedetailed design stage, which would already be committed to the more complicatedarchitecture forced by the ungainly Delay Lines.<p><a name="selectron">An attempt was made</a> starting in 1946by RCA (the Radio Corporation of America) to construct an electrostatic storeof a different class, the <a href="moore.school/selectron.html">SelectronTube</a>. This was the storage von Neumann planned to use for theIAS computer at Princeton, which in turn was the computer Newman was planning tobase <i>his</i> machine on. It was a true random-access store, but it useda totally different technique from the Williams-Kilburn CRT store. It was morelike a multi-faceted vacuum tube, beingpowered by a continuous emission of electrons from a thermionic cathode on theaxis of a cylinder holding the array of charged elements. This had the advantageover CRT-based stores that the screen would not need refreshing on a regularbasis. However the design was very ambitious, and it was a<a href="moore.school/selectron.html#long">long time</a> before they got themechanism to work, and the IAS computer had to be switched to using aWilliams-Kilburn CRT store.<p><em>For the purposes of the following discussion it is convenient to use themodern term RAM to refer to a main electronic store, either electrostaticor Delay Line,which could be accessed at electronic speeds rather than electro-mechanical(e.g. electro-magnetic telephone relays), even thoughthe Delay Line was not truly random-access.</em><h3 align="center"><a name="ukspc">First Working Stored-Program Computers</a></h3><p>Williams and Kilburn immediately wanted to develop a basic computer as the onlyway of fully testing their proposed storage mechanism. Tom Kilburn led thedesign and construction, and the "Small Scale Experimental Machine", theManchester <a href="new.baby.html">"Baby"</a>, was up and running by June 1948.Although small and primitive, it was the first workingmachine to have all the basic ingredients we would regard as essential tothe von Neumann computer, in particular it had a true Random Access Memory andused the stored-program principle. The Baby so successfully demonstrated theeffectiveness and potential of the von Neumann computer that Williamsimmediately embarked on developing the Baby into a full-sized usable machine,the <a href="MM1.html">Manchester Mark 1</a>, and the U.K. government immediatelycontracted Ferranti Ltd. to build a commercial machine based on its design(whatever it would turn out to be!). (Note that although the Baby store wasonly 32 words of 32 bits on a single CRT, the design allowed for up to 8192words, but it was not deemed worth adding more CRTs to the Baby rather thanembarking immediately on the Manchester Mark 1.)<p>In the end the "race" to produce the first "proper" stored-program computer was"won" by the university projects in the U.K., at Manchester and CambridgeUniversities. No doubt they had an advantage in that they could operate withoutgovernmental or commercial constraints. Cambridge had the advantage that theywere using the EDVAC design as a starting point. Manchester had the advantagethat although all their design was their own (accepting the general principleof the von Neumann computer), they were working with a simpler storagemechanism. All the Manchester construction was their own (though they wereeffectively "<a href="new.baby.html#trefund">sponsored</a>" by TRE), except thatin the later stages of developing the Mark1 they had some help from Ferranti,who were already starting work on the commercial version, the<a href="FM1.html">Ferranti Mark 1</a>. Cambridge had help in building the EDSACfrom the J.C. Lyons &amp; Co. Ltd., who later built the LEO 1 based on the EDSAC.<p>The EDSAC at Cambridge came on the air in May 1949, with a fully operational DelayLine store and paper tape input and output, and with an organised computingservice planned, but with no backing store. The Manchester Mark 1 was acontinuous evolution from the Baby, with sections being added or replaced overa period of time.  It was not till around October 1949 that it was fullyoperational, with paper tape input-output, a fast magnetic random-access backing store (a "<b>drum</b>", nowadays the hard disc), andproviding a basic computing service. However it <em>was</em> available forgeneral use for other departments and Ferranti from April 1949, without papertape input-output (you still had to key into store in binary, and read outputfrom <a href="/web/20090105031620/http://www.computer50.org/kgill/williams/display.html">CRT displays</a> in binary).But it did have a prototype drum working, though transfers to and from RAM hadto be done by manual intervention from the keyboard; this was very useful forholding pre-prepared input, output, useful routines, and intermediarycalculations during a long run. In June 1949 it recorded an<a href="notes.html#errorfree">error-free</a> run of 9 hours working on<a href="notes.html#mersenne">Mersenne Primes</a>.<p>It was always the aim of Maurice Wilkes' team at Cambridge (as it hadoriginally been of Max Newman at Manchester) to get a computer built as quicklyand easily as possible so that they could investigate the <em>useof computers</em>, and they can justifiably claim that they got the first"proper" stored-program computer up and running and providing a reasonableComputing Service, with a simple mnemonic programming language. Williams atManchester, and his team of computer designers and builders, always had themajor emphasis on the <em>development of computer design</em>, and users,although necessary and encouraged, were secondary. They were working on a morepowerful and sophisticated machine, with a fast, random-access, integrated and programmable backing store, fully operational by October 1949. And there wasconsiderable government pressure to get the Ferranti Mark 1, for which it wasthe prototype, into production for the national interest as fast as possible.<p>The two projects that were started before the Moore School course, EDVAC andACE, and which might have been expected to be the first running, bothencountered problems at various stages, and in the end were notcompleted until late 1951 and May 1950 respectively.<h3 align="center"><a name="usspc">First Working US Stored-Program Computers</a></h3><p>Meanwhile in the U.S.A. there was progress being made still in 1947-48 withelectro-mechanical and non-stored-program machines, e.g. the Harvard Mark II,improvements to ENIAC, and by IBM -- SSEC and the IBM 604. All of thesemachines had some form of pseudo-stored-program capability, but not the abilityto store a program in RAM. The Harvard Mark III, completed in September 1949had no true RAM, but it did have magnetic drums which acted as the main store,and on which program as well as data was stored.<p>By 1950 true stored-programcomputers with later design starts than EDVAC were being completed, SEAC andSWAC built by the US National Bureau of Standards, and an early version of theWhirlwind built under <b>Jay W. Forrester</b> at MIT for the US Navy. SWAC andWhirlwind had CRT stores, though Forrester had already started work on thesuccessor to Delay Line and Williams-Kilburn CRT stores, themagnetic core store, which was fitted to Whirlwind around 1952/53.<p>As early as August 1949, BINAC was completed, a computer for the US Air Forcebuilt by Eckert and Mauchly, who had broken away from the EDVAC project toform their own company. However this had significant reliability problems,ameliorated by having two identical processors working in tandem. They werealso developing UNIVAC at the same time (see below).<h3 align="center"><a name="commercial">First Commercial Production Computers</a></h3><p>It was not until 1951 that the first commercial production computers appeared.The first <a href="FM1.html">Ferranti Mark 1</a> was delivered in February 1951,closely based on the Manchester Mark 1. It was aimed at the scientific marketrather than the commercial market, and had a fast magnetic drum store of 16,00040-bit words. The first UNIVAC was accepted by theUS Census Department in March 1951; this was the result of Mauchly and Eckertsetting up their own company, by now taken over by Remington Rand, to designand build a computer for general commercial and industrial use. The UNIVAC hada Delay Line RAM and magnetic tape as backing store. In the autumnof 1951 LEO 1 was completed, the version of the EDSAC built by Lyons. This wasoriginally intended purely for in-house use, to help in running their food andrestaurant business, but it was so successful that theyended up building a succession of computers for general sale!<p>Surprisingly it was not till 1953 that IBM delivered its first stored-programcomputer, the IBM 701, using a Williams-Kilburn CRT store. They of coursealready had a large market in business machines and were unhappy in competingagainst it with the new technology.<h3 align="center"><a name="zuse">John V.

Atanasoff</b> is officially credited in the US for inventing theelectronic computer, in preference to Mauchly and Eckert, who designed ENIAC.Atanasoff and a graduate student Clifford Berry built a prototype in 1939 atIowa State University, and built a more advanced machine, the Atanasoff-BerryComputer (ABC) in 1941. Atanasoff joined the war effort soon after and thecomputer never really got off the ground. However Mauchly visited Atanasoff athis house for a few days in 1941 with the aim of finding out allabout ABC; he was shown ABC (already partly working) and he read but was notgiven a copy of Atanasoff's document describingthe machine. In 1973, the patent of Mauchly and Eckert for the invention ofthe electronic computer was overturned in court in favour of Atanasoff.<p><b>Konrad Zuse</b> designed aseries of programmable calculators in Germany between 1938 and 1944. The firstmachine, the Z1, was purely mechanical, but he progressed with an increasingconversion to electrical and electro-mechanical components. He always worked inbinary, and the first progression was to use a telephone relay for storing abit rather than a steel pin that could be held in one of two positions.The last of the machines, the Z4, nearly complete in 1944, was developedafter the war, still using relays for storage, and he formed acompany which eventually sold around 300 machines, the first installed atETH (the Federal Polytechnical Institute) in Zurich in 1950.<p>In contrast to Turing, Zuse arguably had the clearest <em>practical</em>understanding in the 1930s and 1940s of programmable computers and theirshort-to-medium term use.<a name="endofpage"><hr></a><em><font color="#00B6000"><br>Useful Links :   <a href="/web/20090105031620/http://www.computer50.org/index.html">Top Page</a>,                     <a href="index.html">Celebrations Page</a>,                     <a href="mark1intro.html">The Mark 1 story</a>,                     <a href="links.html">External History Links</a>,<br>and in particular I acknowledge a valuable source for this page:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090105031620/http://www.davros.org/misc/chronology.html">Chronology of Digital Computing Machines (up to 1952)</a><br>Context :<a href="/web/20090105031620/http://www.computer50.org/index.html">50th Anniversary</a> pages(<a href="/web/20090105031620/http://www.computer50.org/index.html#mark1">The Mark 1 story</a>,<a href="celebrations.html">Celebrations</a>,<a href="/web/20090105031620/http://www.computer50.org/kgill/index.html">Virtual Museum</a>)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at : the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090105031620/http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">School of Computer Science</a>,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090105031620/http://www.manchester.ac.uk/">The University of Manchester</a><br>Maintainer : <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090105031620/http://www.computer50.org/mark1/rben.html">BrianNapper</a>; last updated August 20th 1999(full <a href="acknowledge.mark1.html">acknowledgements</a>)</font></em><br><font size="1"><center> Copyright The University of Manchester 1998, 1999 </center></font><!--     FILE ARCHIVED ON 03:16:20 Jan 05, 2009 AND RETRIEVED FROM THE     INTERNET ARCHIVE ON 15:05:49 Apr 28, 2018.
