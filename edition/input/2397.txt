Remarkably, many of our                                 modern crops were developed by people who lacked                                 an understanding of the scientific basis of plant                                 breeding.</p>                </td>		</tr>	</table>                        <p>Despite the poor understanding of the process, plant                           breeding was a popular activity. Gregor Mendel himself,                           the father of genetics, was a plant breeder, as were                           some of the leading botanists of his time. Mendel's                           1865 paper (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130121061931/http://www.mendelweb.org/Mendel.html" target="mendel" class="offsite">http://www.MendelWeb.org/Mendel.html</a>)                           explaining how dominant and recessive alleles could                           produce the traits we see and could be passed to offspring                           was the first major insight into the science behind                           the art. The paper was largely ignored until 1900, when                           three scientists working on breeding problems rediscovered                           it and publicized Mendel's findings.</p>                        <p>Major advances in plant breeding followed the revelation                           of Mendel's discovery. Breeders brought their new understanding                           of genetics to the traditional techniques of self-pollinating                           and cross-pollinating plants. </p>			<p>                    	<table>		<tr>			<td valign="top"><img src="/web/20130121061931im_/http://cls.casa.colostate.edu/TransgenicCrops/images/cross_pollinating.jpg" width="288" height="233"><p class="small"><b>Plant breeder Sally Clayshulte collects pollen</b></p></td>			<td valign="top">				              <p>Corn breeders, particularly, tried numerous strategies                                 to capitalize on the insights into heredity. Corn                                 plants that had traditionally been allowed to                                 cross-pollinate freely were artificially self-pollinated                                 for generations and crossed to other self-pollinated                                 lines in an effort to achieve a favorable combination                                 of alleles. The corn we eat today is the result                                 of decades of this strategy of self-pollination                                 followed by cross-pollination to produce vigorous                                 hybrid plants.

Breeders have traditionally                                 scrutinized their fields and traveled to foreign                                 countries searching for individual plants that                                 exhibit desirable traits. Such traits occasionally                                 arise spontaneously through a process called mutation,                                 but the natural rate of mutation is too slow and                                 unreliable to produce all the plants that breeders                                 would like to see. </p>                              <p>In the late 1920s, researchers discovered that                                 they could greatly increase the number of these                                 variations or mutations by exposing plants to                                 X-rays. "Mutation breeding" accelerated after                                 World War II, when the techniques of the nuclear                                 age became widely available. Plants were exposed                                 to gamma rays, protons, neutrons, alpha particles,                                 and beta particles to see if these would induce                                 useful mutations. Chemicals, too, such as sodium                                 azide and ethyl methanesulphonate, were used to                                 cause mutations.</p>				<p>Examples of plants that were produced via mutation breeding are given in the table below.</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>                        <table width="85%" cellpadding="1" border="1" bordercolor="#006600">                          <tr>                             <td><b>Crop</b></td>                            <td><b>Cultivar Name</b></td>                            <td width="48%"><b>Method Used to Induce Mutation</b></td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                             <td width="25%">rice</td>                            <td width="27%">Calrose 76</td>                            <td width="48%">gamma rays</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                             <td rowspan="2">wheat</td>                            <td width="27%">Above</td>                            <td width="48%">sodium azide</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                             <td width="27%">Lewis</td>                            <td width="48%">thermal neutrons</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                             <td width="25%">oats</td>                            <td width="27%">Alamo-X</td>                            <td width="48%">X-rays</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                             <td rowspan="2">grapefruit</td>                            <td width="27%">Rio Red</td>                            <td width="48%">thermal neutrons</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                             <td width="27%">Star Ruby</td>                            <td width="48%">thermal neutrons</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                             <td rowspan="4">burmuda grass</td>                            <td width="27%">Tifeagle</td>                            <td width="48%">gamma rays</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                             <td width="27%">Tifgreen II</td>                            <td width="48%">gamma rays</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                             <td width="27%">Tift 94</td>                            <td width="48%">gamma rays</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                             <td width="27%">Tifway II</td>                            <td width="48%">gamma rays</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                             <td rowspan="2">lettuce</td>                            <td width="27%">Ice Cube</td>                            <td width="48%">ethyl methanesulphonate</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                             <td width="27%">Mini-Green</td>                            <td width="48%">ethyl methanesulphonate</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                             <td rowspan="2">common bean</td>                            <td width="27%">Seafarer</td>                            <td width="48%">X-rays</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                             <td width="27%">Seaway</td>                            <td width="48%">X-rays</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                             <td width="25%">lilac</td>                            <td width="27%">Prairie Petite</td>                            <td width="48%">thermal neutrons</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                             <td rowspan="2">St. Augustine grass</td>                            <td width="27%">TXSA 8202</td>                            <td width="48%">gamma rays</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                             <td width="27%">TXSA 8212</td>                            <td width="48%">gamma rays</td>                          </tr>                        </table>	<table>		<tr>			<td valign="top">				<p>Quite a few flower cultivars have been developed via mutation breeding, among them some of the cultivars of <i>Alstroemeria</i>, begonia, carnation, chrysanthemum, dahlia, and snapdragon.</p>				              <p>Mutation breeding was particularly popular in                                 the United States during the 1970s.

Spontaneously occurring                                 haploid plants, those having half the normal number                                 of chromosomes, were discovered in the 1920s,                                 but haploid breeding was not a practical technique                                 until methods for the controlled production of                                 haploid plants were developed. Once a haploid                                 plant has been obtained, its chromosomes are artificially                                 doubled to return the plant to the normal number                                 of chromosomes.

Organisms that have until now been completely                                 outside the realm of possibility as gene donors                                 can be used to donate desirable traits to crop                                 plants. These organisms do not provide their complete                                 set of genes, but rather donate only one or a                                 few genes to the recipient plant. For example,                                 a single insect-resistance gene from the bacterium                                 <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> can be transferred                                 to a corn plant to make Bt corn.
