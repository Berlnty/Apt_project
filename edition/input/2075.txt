In the late 19th century, tight corsets worn by 	girls when their bodies were still growing had the effect of deforming lower 	rib bones dangerously in towards their lungs.&nbsp; Some rich women even had 	lower ribs surgically removed in order to achieve a stylish &quot;wasp-shaped&quot;

	In China today, there is a growing concern among many upwardly mobile middle 	class men and women that they are too short.&nbsp; Thousands have sought a 	solution to this problem by having their legs lengthened.&nbsp; This is 	achieved by a long, painful process involving the surgical breaking of the 	two lower leg bones in both legs and then using adjustable metal braces that 	are anchored with steel pins implanted in the bone just below the knees and 	above the ankles to progressively extend the length by nearly 1/16 inch 	(about 1 mm.) a day as the bones heal.&nbsp; This widens the gap at the 	break areas, thereby stimulating new bone growth.&nbsp; As a result, the 	average patient permanently adds about 3 inches (7-8 cm.) to their height in 	half a year.</span></font></p>	<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="en-us"> 	Intentional body deformation is a common practice in North America today as 	well.&nbsp; It is customary for middle and upper class parents to have the 	teeth of their children straightened with retainers and braces.&nbsp; This is a long, 	costly, and somewhat painful experience that alters the alignment of teeth.&nbsp; In part, it is done to 	preserve and improve their functioning.&nbsp; However, a strong 	motivation is to enhance&nbsp;appearance.&nbsp; Nose straightening and other 	forms of plastic surgery are often done for the same reason, despite the 	fact that they are painful.&nbsp; It is assumed by parents that these kinds 	of body 	alteration will increase the likelihood that their children will grow up to be more successful in life.&nbsp; This was 	also the motivation of rich Chinese parents in the past who bound the feet of their 	daughters and of contemporary Chinese who undergo leg lengthening.</span></font></p>  <table border="0" align="right" cellspacing="2" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111">    <tr>      <td align="center" rowspan="2" width="7">      &nbsp;</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td align="center">      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Wearing fashionable<br>		high-heeled shoes<br>		can cause foot<br>		deformities and ot</small><span lang="en-us"><small>her<br>		orthopedic problems<br>		over time</small></span></font></td>      <td align="center" width="5">      &nbsp;</td>      <td align="center">      <img border="0" src="/web/20130306124405im_/http://anthro.palomar.edu/adapt/images/high_heels.jpg" vspace hspace="0" alt="photo of a woman wearing fashionable high-healed shoes" width="96" height="120"></td>    </tr>    </table>  <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Permanent  changes to the shape of body parts may be unintended.&nbsp;
