PIT<br>                </b></p>              <p align="left">By Alan H. Goodman<br>                Anthropology Newsletter, May 1998</p>              <p>Recent commentaries and letters in Anthropology Newsletter show                 that many of my biological anthropology colleagues have fallen                 into the race pit. Let's pull them out! But first, they must realize                 they are in a pit so that they will extend a hand.              <p>Falling into the race pit is easy to do. Racial terms are frequently                 used and are very familiar. To paraphrase Henry Louis Gates, we                 see and are seen as race. Race is a trope, a floating signifier.                 Race is lived experience and a sociopolitical construct. It is                 not biology.              <p>Falling into the race pit starts with thinking that race is a                 biological and scientific concept. It is as easy as unreflectively                 using racial terms to describe a skull. The racial terms than                 take on power when they connect to imbued meanings.              <p>It takes vigilance to avoid falling into the race pit; and it                 takes a thoughtful and scientific effort to get to deeper meaning.                 The race pit is most harmful because it is a place from which                 one cannot advance to understand human variation. Medical proclamations                 made without a biological basis result in a great deal of unseen                 harm. And, in some cases, scientific statements feed political                 abuse.              <p><b>Silent Violence and Racism</b>              <p>It is hardly radical to suggest that there are connections -                 sometimes subtle and indirect through words, ideas, programs and                 actions - between soft uses of race in everyday science and blatant                 racism. Falsely maintaining that race is real biologically leaves                 the door open to misuse. It is an easy step from the misuse of                 race in studies of skull shape or hemoglobin levels to its misuse                 in studies of intelligence.              <p>We have also seen many times the leap from the misuse of race                 in science to its misuse in public policy. Bad science always                 makes bad policy. But educating that biological differences between                 groups are not deep, hereditary and fixed eliminates a major weapon                 in the racists' arsenal. It exposes racism as the human social                 evil that it is.              <p>Kennewick Man continues to be a clear example of not just what                 is wrong scientifically with race, but also of the potential misuse                 by racists. James Chatters suggests that he did not intend to                 racialize Kennewick Man (February 1998 AN, p. 19). But it was                 not just I who saw race in racial words. Jonathan Mozzochi, research                 director of the Coalition for Human Dignity, has been following                 reports of Kennewick Man in the right-wing press. He shows that                 the Asatru Folk Assembly, partners with anthropologists on the                 legal suit to allow study of Kennewick Man, is not a harmless                 bunch of spiritualist crazies. Their leaders have extensive neo-Nazi                 connections. Additionally, Louis Beam, a former Texas Klansman                 and "ambassador at large" for the Aryan Nations, has written numerous                 articles in such rags as The Spotlight, a large circulation, anti-Semitic                 weekly, in which he uses the identification of Kennewick Man as                 a "Caucasoid" to support the view that the Americas were first                 settled by whites ("Races and Relics," The Dignity Report, 1998,                 5, p. 4). Aren't scientists responsible for speaking out against                 unintended interpretations of their words and ideas?              <p><b>Back to Basics</b>              <p>To judge from the discussions at the 1997 AAA presidential panel                 on race, it is now widely accepted in anthropology that race is                 a biological myth but that racial discrimination and racism are                 all too real (C Mukhopadhyay, March 1998, AN, p. 28). This consensus,                 however, does not yet include many physical anthropologists. Fundamental                 errors are voiced in recent letters and commentaries in the AN                 submitted by skeletal biologists who, with other physical anthropologists,                 lay claim to scientific authority and are key to articulating                 anthropological perspectives on human diversity. The first error                 is that the idea of race is confused with the reality of human                 biological variation. A second error occurs when race as biology                 is confused with race as sociocultural construct. It's time to                 go back to basics.              <p>It has been known for decades that racial typology fails to explain                 human variation, that is, our species does not fit into a small                 number of fixed, ideal types. We know, for example, that:              <ul>                <li>Human variation is generally continuous, with no clear points                   of demarcation. (It is impossible to reliably say where one                   race ends and another begins. Groups living close to each other                   tend to be biologically alike, and so race has an appearance                   of reality, but this is only geographic similarity.)<br>                  <br>                </li>                <li>Human variation is highly nonconcordant. One trait infrequently                   predicts for another. (One can not read deeper meanings into                   physical cues.)<br>                  <br>                </li>                <li>There is greater variation within than among purported races.                   (Knowing an individual's purported race tells us little about                   the individual.)</li>              </ul>              <p>Although there is no disagreement with these points, about half                 of all physical anthropologists continue to think race is a salient                 concept and many teach and do research on human variation from                 a racial approach. They continue to use race because they think                 that race shifted from a typological to a population concept starting                 with Carleton Coon's work after World War II. Gill writes that                 Ashley Montagu and his followers failed to notice (1990).</p>              <p>But as much as my colleagues might want to see racial analysis                 as having made a paradigm shift from a typological to population                 concept, this is not possible because races are not populations,                 and adaptation and evolution work locally rather than at the abstracted                 level of races. In common usage, scientists, students and the                 public reduce human variation to 3 or 4 types, just as they did                 a century ago. Color lines shift, but the underlying concept,                 contra Gill, endures. Montagu did notice; he just did not buy                 it. As J. Buettner-Janusch remarked in his review of Coon's The                 Living Races of Race (1965), "Typology, typology, typology, nothing                 by typology" (American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 1966,                 p. 187).              <p>George Armelagos has characterized the race concept as a chameleon,                 which changed its color, but not its reality as a folk concept,                 to survive the Darwinian revolution, the evolutionary synthesis                 of the 1930s and the new physical anthropology of more recent                 years. Compare this with the common refrain that those who deny                 race are simply trying to be "politically correct." Gill writes                 that "they have their hearts, but not their heads in the right                 place." (Gill and S. Rhine, Skeletal Attribution of Race, 1990,                 p. viii). What is so "heady" about a concept that cannot be explained                 or defined?              <p><b>Classification Wrongs</b>              <p>In addition to convincing themselves that race is an evolutionary                 concept, there is an additional reason why anthropologists still                 use the concept: race is convenient. By analogy, classifying hats                 by size allows us to pick those most likely to fit. The classification                 may not be perfect, but it is a useful start. Gill suggests that                 racial classification is no different than classification by sex,                 age or height (March 1998 AN, p. 1). The analogy, however, falls                 on its nasal spine.              <p>When a hatter sizes a hat, she knows what she is measuring and                 her work can be repeated. Classifications by sex, age or height                 might not be perfect, but the criteria are sensible, they fit                 the problem and they are agreed upon. Conversely, because race                 is socially defined, it is first like classifying by a concept                 such as "beauty," with no way to compare standards of beauty across                 classifiers and then having others decide to classify by "purity."                 The problem is that there is no objective and repeatable standard                 of classification. As a result, use of race in biomedicine, where                 repeatability is monumentally important, courts disaster.              <p>It gets worse. The unexamined movement from social definition                 of race to biology leads to conflation of nature and lived experience.                 This clouds whether observed racial differences in athletic performance,                 birth weight or IQ are due to lived experience, genes, or a tangled                 gene-environment combination.              <p>Furthermore, when genes come into play, the assumption is that                 a racial analysis might substitute for a more detailed individual                 genetic analysis. Separate U.S. black and white standards for                 diagnosis of anemia have been constructed because it was found                 that blacks have lower mean hemoglobin concentrations (the basis                 of diagnosis of anemia) than whites. It was thus suggested in                 the 1970s that the standard for diagnoses of anemia in blacks                 should match this inherited, pan-racial characteristic. The consequence                 of lowering the black standard halves the number of black women                 diagnosed as anemic and probably too the percent treated.              <p>Robert and Fatimah Jackson have demonstrated two grand leaps                 of scientific faith in constructing race specific standards (Ethnicity                 and Disease, 1991, p. 1). First, hemoglobin differences between                 blacks and whites are almost entirely explained by environmental                 factors (conflation of nature and lived experience). Second, there                 is no basis to assume that a genetic difference is pan African                 American (conflation of genes and race). Race as biology is not                 just wrong, it is harmful.              <p>James Chatters apologizes for using the term "Caucasoid" to describe                 Kennewick Man's biology and then excuses himself by saying no                 other words would do. But there are many precise terms that are                 nonracial. For example, Chatters could have described Kennewick                 Man as having a large nasal spine. Because this trait is frequently                 seen in some contemporary groups, its presence in Kennewick Man                 might suggest a biological relationship. This is different, however,                 from proclaiming that Kennewick Man is a member of a group that                 only exists in an individual's mind.              <p>If Frank Livingstone (U. Michigan) had continued to think of                 it as a racial disease (rather than as clinally distributed),                 he likely would not have so clearly seen the relationship between                 sickle cell anemia and the spread of malaria. Race science is                 bad science because it inhibits deeper understanding.              <p><b>From Biology to Lived Experience</b>              <p>Human biological variability is real. But race is a biological                 sham: it is theoretically pass�, does not fit the facts, holds                 back science and causes harm. A common sleight of hand of the                 political right is to conflate the myth of biological race with                 the cultural experience of race, e.g., "If race is a (biological)                 myth, let's get rid of affirmative action." But the truth is just                 the opposite. Showing that race is a biological myth leads us                 to clarify the sociopolitical salience of race and racism. Race                 as biology does not explain the persistent and shameful rate at                 which black babies suffer low birth weight and infant mortality.                 It doesn't explain why the death rate from breast cancer recently                 fell for all women but did not budge for black women, who already                 had a higher rate of death. Nor does race as biology explain why                 black male life expectancy in Harlem is less than the life expectancy                 of men in Bangladesh. But the suffering is still there.              <p>There is no half way between seeing race as biologically valid                 or not. Any reformation of race as biology will simply be interpreted                 as race in the older typological paradigm. What do we lose by                 giving up race as a biological concept? We lost some instant recognition                 of what we do. It takes a bit longer to explain human variation.              <p>What do we gain by sending race to the dust heap of history?                 The possibilities are awesome. We could develop a new and exciting                 biocultural paradigm.
