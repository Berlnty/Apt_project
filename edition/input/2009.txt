This indicates some 9 million tobacco deaths innon-developedcountries during the 1990s and (using the same ratio) perhaps 5 millionduringthe 1980s. If we continue this ratio all the way back, we get an evenhundredmillion deaths by tobacco worldwide; however, as Peto puts it, "theepidemic is generally at an earlier stage," so the tobacco-relatedmortality rate in the third world was relatively low before 1980.

My source for therawnumbers is Watenburg, <i>TheStatistical History of the United States</i>(1976). As an example of my methods, consider this: in 1920, the deathrate forwhites was 12.6/1000, while for non-whites it was 17.7/1000. Now, if wemultiply the non-white death rate by the estimated non-white populationof10,951,000, we find that there were approximately 193,833 deaths amongnon-whites in 1920. If they had died at the white death rate, however,therewould only have been 137,983 deaths. Therefore, we've got 55,850 excessdeathscaused by the socioeconomic handicap of not being white.</li>      <li>Decade by decade, hereare the totals:        <table align="center" border="1">          <tbody>            <tr>              <th>Decade </th>              <th align="right">ExcessDeaths</th>            </tr>            <tr>              <th>1960s </th>              <td align="right">65,000</td>            </tr>            <tr>              <th>1950s </th>              <td align="right">200,000</td>            </tr>            <tr>              <th>1940s </th>              <td align="right">300,000</td>            </tr>            <tr>              <th>1930s </th>              <td align="right">535,000</td>            </tr>            <tr>              <th>1920s </th>              <td align="right">630,000</td>            </tr>            <tr>              <th>1910s </th>              <td align="right">735,000</td>            </tr>            <tr>              <th>1900s </th>              <td align="right">835,000</td>            </tr>            <tr>              <th>TOTAL </th>              <td align="right">3,300,000</td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table>        <p><br />        </p>      </li>      <li>Escape Hatch: Since noone's paying me to be mired in controversy, I'llgive a short list of why this calculation might not mean what it seemsto mean.

If you sum the first five of the century's<a href="http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/atrox.htm">top30 atrocities</a>, you get a bitover 142M. Summingthe first 10 brings the total to 157M, while the sum of the first 20 is171.7M. It may look like, at this rate, we'll shoot past 188M in notime at all, butnotice how the body counts get smaller at each level -- from 142M forthe 1st 5to 15M for the next 5 to a mere 14M or so for the next 10. Pretty soon,we getto the point where a single atrocity doesn't noticably shift the totalat all.</p><p>[<a href="#TotalEst">back</a>]</p><hr /><p><a href="http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/20centry.htm">toTable of Contents</a></p><p>Last updated September 2010</p><p>Copyright &copy; 1999-2010 <a href="http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/maildrop.htm">MatthewWhite</a></p></body></html>
