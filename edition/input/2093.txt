</span>The answer to this question is not simple.&nbsp; There are  three basic ways  in which anthropologists have tried to do it in the past.&nbsp; These are generally  referred to as the <font color="#333333">typological</font>,<font color="#333333"> populational</font>, and<font color="#333333"> clinal models</font>.</font></p>  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#008080" size="1">  <br>  </font></font><b><font face="Arial" color="#808080" size="5">Typological  Model</font></b></p>  <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">During the 19th and early 20th centuries,  anthropologists and biologists naively divided all people into 	<span lang="en-us">distinct </span>geographic<span lang="en-us">al</span> groups on the basis of what  they saw as the regular occurrence together of selected traits.&nbsp;

This approach focuses on a  small number of traits that are readily observable from a distance such as skin color,  hair form, body build, and stature.<span lang="en-us">&nbsp; Inherent in the 	typological model is the notion that there have been &quot;pure&quot; unmixed races in 	the past.</span>&nbsp; The roots of   this model for classifying people go back at least to the 18th   century Swedish naturalist, <font color="#333333"><b>Carolus Linnaeus</b></font>.&nbsp;

on the basis of selected<span lang="en-us"> 	anatomical </span>traits.&nbsp; In fact, when we look at specific individuals, we often run into difficulty  trying to categorize them.&nbsp; For example, on the basis of skin color, we might put  them into one &quot;race&quot; and on the basis of nose shape, body form, or blood type,  they might go into others.<span lang="en-us">&nbsp; </span></font></p>	<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="en-us">Even if we 	base the classification on a single characteristic, the typological model 	fails because most biological traits are continuous variables.&nbsp; That is 	to say, there is a progressive range of variation that our preconceptions 	sometimes prevent us from seeing.&nbsp; The typological model causes us to 	lump people together into arbitrarily assigned categories.&nbsp; For 	instance, we tend to classify people as being slender, medium build, or fat 	despite the fact that there is a continuum of body weight and size among 	humans.&nbsp; The same is true of skin color and other commonly used 	&quot;racial&quot; characteristics.</span></font></p>	<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial">The typological model 	usually leads us to wrongly assume that the people within any &quot;race&quot; are 	genetically and anatomically more alike than they are like people from other 	&quot;races.&quot;&nbsp; This all depends on the traits that are being compared.&nbsp; 	For instance, many Americans believe that people of African descent have 	broad noses.&nbsp; In fact, both the widest and the narrowest noses are 	found among the people of that continent.&nbsp; </font></span>	<font face="Arial"><strong style="font-weight: 400"><span lang="en-us">	Recent research comparing human DNA sequences from around the world has 	shown that 90% of human genetic variation exists within what we have 	previously assumed to be more or less separate &quot;races&quot; and only 10% between 	them.&nbsp; In other words, &quot;racial&quot; groups are far from being homogenous.</span></strong></font></p>	<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Another major problem with the typological  model is that the number of &quot;races&quot; you end up with depends on the number and  kinds of traits employed in the classification.&nbsp; The more traits used, the fewer  people in the world there are who share them.&nbsp; For example, light skin color is  considered to be a defining characteristic of Europeans.&nbsp; However, when you add the  criteria of narrow noses, straight hair, and tall stature, many Europeans would be  excluded altogether or the European racial category would have to be further subdivided  into several smaller &quot;races<span lang="en-us">.</span>&quot;&nbsp; Since the number of &quot;races&quot; can be so  easily changed by the way they are defined, it is clear that they do not really  exist as distinct biological groupings of people.&nbsp; Instead, they are arbitrary  creations that reflect our <a href="glossary.htm#ethnocentrism">ethnocentric</a> <a href="sounds/ethnocentric.mp3">  <img src="/web/20130106212400im_/http://anthro.palomar.edu/vary/images/horn.gif" alt="click this icon to hear the preceding term pronounced" align="absbottom" border="0" width="20" height="19"></a> views of ourselves and other  people.<span lang="en-us">&nbsp;

The example of red hair in England  (described in the first section of this tutorial) is not unique.&nbsp; There  are other traits that have non-clinal distribution patterns.&nbsp; These also can  be understood as results of historical migrations or exclusive breeding within more or less closed  communities. &nbsp;For example, the map below shows that the frequency of people  who have the B blood allele generally increases from east Asia to  central Asia. &nbsp;Within this more or less continuous cline, there are isolated pockets of relatively low B  allele frequency. &nbsp;Therefore, the distribution of this genetically inherited trait appears  to be mostly <a href="glossary.htm#clines">clinal</a> but, in part, it is also  <a href="glossary.htm#discontinuous_distribution">discontinuous</a>.</font></p>  <div align="center"><center>    <table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111">    <tr>      <td align="center">		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Clinal and discontinuous<br>		distribution<span lang="en-us"> </span>of the B blood<br>		allele in Asia</font></td>      <td width="15" align="center">&nbsp;</td>      <td align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">      <img src="/web/20130106212400im_/http://anthro.palomar.edu/vary/images/map_of_B_blood_clines_in_Asia.gif" alt="map of Asia showing B blood type frequencies--they are generally higher in Central and Eastern Asia, but there are isolated pockets of low B frequencies in southern China and Siberia" width="303" height="262"></font></td>    </tr>    </table>  </center></div>  <p align="center"><b><font face="Arial" color="#808080"><br>	</font><font face="Arial" color="#808080" size="5">How   Can Human   Variation Be Best Described?</font></b></p>  <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">It is clear that all of the   models fail to adequately carry out the entire job.&nbsp; The <a href="glossary.htm#typological_model">typological model</a> is  the most unsound because presumed racial traits are not found exclusively within defined  races.&nbsp; In addition, focusing on new sets of traits often results in assigning  people to different races, despite the fact that they were lumped into the same race  before.&nbsp; The <a href="glossary.htm#populational_model">populational model</a> makes  sense theoretically but fails to account for most of the distribution patterns around the  world because we do not limit our breeding to isolated populations.&nbsp; The <a href="glossary.htm#clinal_model">clinal model</a> comes the closest to grasping the real  nature of human variation.&nbsp; However, it is undermined by the occasional discontinuous  distribution resulting from migrations and the few remaining small isolated communities.&nbsp;  The patterns of human variation around the  world are not only highly complex but also are constantly shifting through time.&nbsp;  Furthermore, the rate of change in the patterns has been accelerating as our numbers grow and as long  distance travel and migration become more routine.</font><font face="Arial"><strong style="font-weight: 400"><span lang="en-us">&nbsp;

In fact,   we <span lang="en-us">apparently </span>are 99.9% genetically identical.&nbsp; Most of the differences between us   are due to our unique individual traits and being male or female.&nbsp; When we are compared to many other   kinds of  animals, it is remarkable how little variation exists within our own species.&nbsp;  There is 2-3   times more genetic variation among chimpanzees, 8-10 times more among   orangutans, and thousands of times more in many insect species.&nbsp; Most   <span lang="en-us">biological</span> anthropologists would agree that human variation is not now   sufficient to warrant defining separate biological races, varieties, or   sub-species.&nbsp;
